Mouthwash is designed to kill germs in your mouth. It is, I’d have to say, pretty good at its job. And yet: we do not seriously trust mouthwash to prevent the transmission of common colds, strep infections, or any other mouth-germ-y illness. We shouldn’t get our hopes up it will be an effective way to avoid getting COVID-19 either.

There have been a few studies testing the effects of mouthwash on SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19) and they are interesting and potentially useful, especially for healthcare workers. For example, if using mouthwash before a dental visit temporarily reduces the amount of virus in your mouth, that might help reduce your dentist’s risk of getting sick.

And that’s really the level of protection that scientists are evaluating when they look at mouthwash and coronavirus. Unfortunately, the way some people are sharing the latest story, it seems like there is some hope that mouthwash is a new tool we can use to protect ourselves in our everyday lives . The study these breathless news articles are based on doesn’t support that conclusion , though—or at least not yet.

What’s the new study about?

The latest study on mouthwash, reported with headlines like “Common mouthwashes may help fight the coronavirus,” describes an experiment involving:

Human cells grown in the lab (not in an actual human being) One of the other human coronaviruses.

That’s right, the virus being experimented on here is not the one that causes COVID-19, but a less harmful one called HCoV‐229e, one of the many viruses responsible for the common cold. What works against this virus probably also works against the one we’re worried about, so it was a fair choice for an experiment.

With this setup, the investigators tried a few different mouthwashes and drugstore products to see which ones inactivated most of the virus. Here’s what they said about the products that worked:

A 1% baby shampoo nasal rinse solution inactivated HCoV [the cold-causing coronaivirus] greater than 99.9% with a 2‐min contact time. Several over‐the‐counter mouthwash/gargle products including Listerine and Listerine‐like products were highly effective at inactivating infectious virus with greater than 99.9% even with a 30‐s contact time. In the current manuscript we have demonstrated that several commonly available healthcare products have significant virucidal properties with respect to HCoV.

(Not mentioned above because it didn’t pass the tests: a nasal rinse recipe included with a CVS neti pot, which involved salt and baking soda.)

This study is not the first to test the idea that mouthwash might help prevent transmission of COVID-19. A review published earlier this year breaks down the evidence that mouthwash should be able to help. Briefly: SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus; ingredients in mouthwash can disrupt this type of envelope; less virus in your mouth probably means a lower chance of transmission. To be clear, if you’re infected, using mouthwash would result in a temporary reduction in the amount of infectious virus in your mouth. It wouldn’t make you any less sick.

This all makes sense, but nobody has tested this idea in anything approaching a real- world setting. The authors of the review laid out several of the questions that need to be addressed by future research, and they told SELF that clinical trials are underway.

What does this mean for me?

So far, not much. The most likely way this will affect your life is that someday your dentist or doctor may ask you to use mouthwash before or at the beginning of a visit.

This research does not mean that mouthwash is a substitute for wearing a mask, or that science has conquered the coronavirus. If you are infected, the virus is still reproducing in your cells and doing its best to escape and infect another host, whether you use mouthwash or not.

If mouthwash is already a thing you use and you feel like doing an extra swish or two, there’s a possibility that doing so will reduce your chances of transmitting the virus. But nobody has tested this specifically. If you’re thinking “well, it can’t hurt,” it’s also worth noting that mouthwash chemicals can sometimes be harsh and irritating, especially with frequent use. The best thing to do right now is to smile because you can see that researchers are working on this important question. T hen continue wearing your mask and distancing as usual.","['sorry', 'study', 'coronavirus', 'virus', 'products', 'covid19', 'transmission', 'way', 'cure', 'mouthwash', 'help', 'mouth', 'isnt']"

Navigating air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic has been tricky. First and foremost, you want to make sure that you’re as safe as possible. On top of that, there are fewer routes and flights available, travel restrictions, and other guidelines that seem to be constantly changing.

Unlike after 9/11—when there were sweeping changes made to air travel—there are no federal mandates for mask-wearing or keeping middle seats open on flights, nor any industry-wide standards. That means that it’s up to each airline individually to set their own rules. And, as it turns out, not all airlines are created equal, according to Brian Kelly, better known as The Points Guy, the CEO and founder of the travel website of the same name. Here’s what he wants you to know before booking your next flight.

Don’t make assumptions

The wide range of changes to air travel over the past few months—including updated cancellation policies and mask requirements—have been in the news a lot. But just because you see one airline doing something doesn’t mean that it’s an industry standard.

G/O Media may get a commission Sony WH-1000XM4 $218 at Backmarket Use the promo code Kinja2020

For example, though Delta (which for the time being is operating at 75% capacity), JetBlue, Southwest, and Alaska are all currently blocking middle seats on their flights (at least through the holidays), Kelly says that consumers shouldn’t expect that policy across the board.

“We’ve seen about half of U S carriers take steps to social distance on planes, meaning seat blocking or capacity controls,” he tells Lifehacker. “So the issue there is that, when you fly those airlines, people expect one experience, but when you fly American or United, you’re getting a fully jam-packed plane most of the time. I think for consumers, the biggest thing is that no two airlines are the same.”

In other words, if you book a flight on United (or another airline that doesn’t have the open middle seat policy), there’s a good chance that you’ll find someone in the middle seat. We know flying itself can be stressful—let alone during a pandemic—so the last thing airline passengers and crew need is to deal with someone having an outburst because they thought the middle seat would be open when it’s not. Again, to avoid a situation like this, Kelly recommends checking an airline’s capacity and social distancing guidelines before booking a ticket.

Understand that fares are only one part of the ticket cost

While there may be exceptionally low fares right now, Kelly reminds us that fares are only one component of your ticket. “Even though change fees are gone, baggage fees and other fees are still around,” he explains. So instead of simply looking at the fare itself when comparison shopping, consider the total cost of the ticket when you factor in baggage, priority boarding, or any other extras.

If two fares are the same, Kelly says that it’s important to look at what you get for your money. For example, if the fare on Southwest is the same (or even a little more) than American, keep in mind that you’ll get two free bags when you fly on Southwest, that you would otherwise have to pay for on American.

And this applies to middle seat policies, too. “It’s up to the consumer to understand, but you may want to pay a little bit more on Delta to know that you’re going to have an empty middle seat,” Kelly explains. “Do your diligence on what the flying experience is going to be like on different airlines. Don’t assume every airline is blocking middle seats. It’s just not true.”","['middle', 'fares', 'youre', 'coronavirus', 'travel', 'ticket', 'booking', 'policies', 'seat', 'kelly', 'airlines', 'check', 'air', 'airline']"

The disease hit older people and people with underlying medical conditions the hardest. As early as February, diabetes had emerged as one of the conditions associated with the highest risk. In one large study out of China, people with diabetes were more than three times as likely to die of Covid-19 than the overall population.

Everything You Need to Know About the Coronavirus Here's all the WIRED coverage in one place, from how to keep your children entertained to how this outbreak is affecting the economy.

But that’s not what brought four diabetes experts from Australia and the United Kingdom onto a Zoom call back in April. They were supposed to just be catching up—a virtual tea among friends. But talk soon turned to something strange that they’d been seeing in their own hospitals and hearing about through the grapevine. The weird thing was that people were showing up in Covid-19 wards, after having tested positive for the virus, with lots of sugar in their blood. These were people with no known history of diabetes. But you wouldn't know it from their lab results.

After that call, the experts reached out to colleagues in other countries to see if they’d seen or heard of similar cases. They had.

Acute viral infections of all sorts can stress the body, causing blood sugar levels to rise. So that in itself wasn’t unusual, says Francesco Rubino, a bariatric surgeon and diabetes researcher at King’s College in London, who was on that first Zoom call. “What we were seeing and hearing was a little bit different.”

Doctors around the world had described to him strange situations in which Covid-19 patients were showing symptoms of diabetes that didn’t fit the typical two-flavor manifestation of the disease. In most people with type 1 diabetes, their immune cells suddenly turn traitorous, destroying the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin—the hormone that allows glucose to exit the bloodstream and enter cells. People with type 2 diabetes have a different problem; their body slowly becomes resistant to the insulin it does produce. Rubino and his colleagues were seeing blended features of both types showing up spontaneously in people who’d recently been diagnosed with Covid-19. “That was the first clinical puzzle,” he says.

For clues to an explanation, Rubino and his colleagues looked to ACE2, the protein receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to invade human cells. It appears in the airways, yes, but also in other organs involved in controlling blood sugar, including the gut. Doctors in China discovered copies of the coronavirus in the poop of their Covid-19 patients. And a meta-analysis found that gastrointestinal symptoms plague one out of 10 Covid-19 sufferers.

In the last few decades, scientists have discovered that the gut is not the passive digestive organ once thought. It actually is a major endocrine player—responsible for producing hormone signals that talk to the pancreas, telling it to make more insulin, and to the brain, ordering it to make its owner stop eating. If the coronavirus is messing with these signals, that could provide a biological basis for why Covid-19 would be associated with different forms of diabetes, including hybrid and previously unknown manifestations of the disease. Rubino is one of a growing number of researchers who think that the relationship between the coronavirus and diabetes is actually a two-way street. Having diabetes doesn’t just tip the odds toward contracting a worse case of Covid-19. In some people, the virus might actually trigger the onset of diabetes, and the potential for a lifetime of having to manage it.","['diabetes', 'covid', 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'probes', 'global', 'effort', 'having', 'disease', 'data', 'sugar', 'rubino', 'seeing', 'showing', 'causes', 'cells']"

It’s been about seven months since air travel as we knew it changed amid the novel coronavirus outbreak. Now as people are slowly starting to fly again—with even more expected to take the plunge during the holiday season—the question is how to do so in the safest way possible. One idea floating around is that flying in the first-class cabin gives you a bit more distance between you and your fellow passengers, and therefore must come with a reduced risk of COVID-19 transmission. But there’s more to it than that. Here’s what you should know before shelling out the extra money for a ticket upgrade.

Why first class may seem safer

When you think about it, the theory makes sense. According to a survey conducted by the International Air Transport Association, 65% of participants said that sitting next to someone with COVID-19 on a plane was their biggest concern about air travel. So naturally, having more personal space—like you would in first or business class—could help alleviate those concerns.

Advertisement

There’s also the idea that having fewer people in first class could also reduce the risk of transmission. As a recent article in CN Traveler points out, this isn’t just the case when you’re actually on the plane: “From check-in to boarding and deplaning, premium passengers usually face smaller lines and less commotion throughout their journey.”

G/O Media may get a commission Sony WH-1000XM4 $218 at Backmarket Use the promo code Kinja2020

But is it actually safer?

In short, not really. CN Traveler posed this question to two infectious disease experts, and neither seemed to think that flying first class is a safer option for travelers from the perspective of COVID-19 transmission risk.

According to Dr. David Aronoff, director of the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, there’s no data to support the idea that first class passengers are safer from COVID-19 than their counterparts in economy. He does, however, point out that he sees the logic in assuming the risk is lower with fewer people in the cabin, “but it’s hard to say that it is really worth that extra amount of money,” he told CN Traveler.

As it turns out, the hospital-grade HEPA air filters used on planes are not limited to the first class section—they offer the same level of protection regardless of where you’re seated. “It really doesn’t make much difference where you sit on the plane,” Dr. Mark Gendreau, chief medical officer at Beverly and Addison Gilbert hospital, told CN Traveler. “What’s most important are the precautions we are carrying out: face masks, proper hand hygiene, sanitizing surfaces. The air carriers are doing their part disinfecting the cabin between flights, and they’ve stepped it up. The last thing they need is a rash of infected cases on their airplanes.”

Congress tried in coronavirus relief packages passed this spring to shield Covid-19 patients from unexpected medical charges — and yet many patients continue to receive heartstoppingly large bills that their insurance companies won’t cover.

One patient in Philadelphia was flown between hospitals by helicopter while she was unconscious and returned home weeks later to a $52,112 bill from the air ambulance company. Another faces as much as $4,000 in medical debt after spending 10 days at an in-network hospital in Austin, Texas, because many of the doctors at the hospital were out-of-network.

Our colleague Sarah Kliff told us that patients were often charged fees by providers or companies that they didn’t choose or even realized were involved in their care. A big reason for these exorbitant charges, she said, is private equity.

 Digital contact tracing wasn’t up for debate in senior living facilities Steve Kasch’s mom, Julia, was always worried about losing her keys. “She wasn’t eve… [+21305 chars]","Steve Kasch’s mom, Julia, was always worried about losing her keys. “She wasn’t even driving, but she was checking her purse every ten minutes,” he says.

Kasch told me that his mom was fairly independent, but over the past few years, her memory started to go. She would forget if she ate a meal or, more troubling, forget if she took medication. “She might think she took her pill, and not take it for three days,” he says. “Or she might take six in one day.”

In December, Kasch and his wife realized she couldn’t keep living on her own, and they started shopping around for an assisted living facility. The Legacy at Town Square in Amarillo, Texas, stood out. It gave each resident a location-monitoring, emergency button-equipped wristband — which also swiped them into their rooms. “Now, there’s no keys,” Kasch says.

Just after she moved in, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down access to senior care facilities, many of which have been flattened by the virus. The wristbands, already a draw for family members like Kasch, became even more of a selling point. They’re made by a company called CarePredict. CarePredict normally markets its devices to caregivers as tools that track changes in older adults’ behavior. They monitor things like activity level and walking patterns. But when the COVID-19 pandemic started devastating nursing homes, the team quickly spun up a new feature: automatic contact tracing.

The team quickly spun up a new feature: automatic contact tracing

Contact tracing helps control the spread of an infectious disease by tracking down anyone who has been in contact with a sick person and monitoring them to check if they caught the disease. Usually, it’s done manually by interviewing patients and asking them who they’d been in contact with. But facilities equipped with CarePredict already track peoples’ every move. The systems are packed with data on the interactions of anyone with a wristband.

“You could rewind and replay,” says Jerry Wilmink, the chief business officer at CarePredict.

For months, tech companies like Google and Apple and countries like Germany and the United Kingdom have tried to use high-tech systems to automate the contact tracing process. They’re appealing, quick solutions, but they’ve been slow to get off the ground and are hobbled by concerns around efficacy, privacy, and adoption. While public health experts argue tech-driven contact tracing has a role in the fight against the coronavirus, there’s open debate over how and if that might happen.

Some senior living facilities in the United States, though, are already quietly using automated systems to guide contact tracing, facilitated by companies like CarePredict.

The privacy concerns that haunt broader tech-based contact tracing efforts are present in those environments, too, but they often aren’t considered. Because the tools are used for older adults, it’s assumed that the benefits are worth any trade-offs. Concerns around autonomy and choice aren’t given the same weight, says Clara Berridge, a professor at the University of Washington who studies health care technology in aging populations.

“Autonomy and privacy are super interlinked,” Berridge says. “And we tend to undervalue both of those things for older adults. Instead, safety is at the forefront.”

Wilmink showed me the CarePredict monitoring system in action. “I’m going to share my screen to show you,” he told me, before pulling up the dashboard for a Lifewell senior living community and sharing his screen. It showed the floorplans of the building, with blue and green dots clustered in the numbered rooms and open spaces. “This is real time. The blue dots are the residents, and the green dots are the staff,” Wilmink told me.

Next to the floorplans, a sidebar showed a list of every resident and staffer. For my sake, they replaced the names with strings of characters. $bsvobtbifcb was in room 315, a bedroom, and had a low battery. $nbsztusjdlmfs was in room 109, the kitchen. Live alerts continued to fill the screen. “You can see, for instance, this individual in their kitchen had pressed the button on their wearable, and this staff member has selected to address this particular alert,” Wilmink says.

Next, Wilmink clicks through to the contact tracing report feature. He selects resident $bmkvez from a drop-down menu. “I look at this particular resident here,” he says. “Say they test positive today.” He sets the calendar to cover from May 12th to May 19th. “Let’s go back a week.”

Immediately, a list pops up of around a dozen other residents and staffers. It lists their name and the length of time that their wearable location monitoring tag was nearby $bmkvez’s wearable location monitoring tag. It also notes the length of time they were in close proximity — five minutes, three hours — and the room where it happened.

The system can quickly generate a list of everyone else who may need to be tested or quarantined

If a resident or staff member actually tested positive for COVID-19 or started showing symptoms, the system can quickly generate a list of everyone else who may need to be tested or quarantined. Some Lifewell living facilities have already used the feature to track down the contacts of people who tested positive. Most of the time, the initial case has been of a staff member, Greg Zobel, chief operating officer at CarePredict, told me during the demonstration. The system can then help track every person a staff member interacted with.

The Legacy at Town Square, the Lifewell facility in Amarillo, Texas, doesn’t have any positive COVID-19 cases. But it has had people tested for the virus, and it used the contact tracing tool while they were waiting for the test results to come back. Joe Walter, the executive director of the facility, says it’s useful.

“We were super pumped when they came out with the contact tracing, because it’s just such a time saver,” Walter says. “It’s so much more thorough than me, and my management team, and whoever’s involved trying to remember, ok, where was I the last 14 days.”

Care facilities like the Legacy at Town Square then don’t have to rely on their elderly residents to retrace their steps. “Good luck having them remember,” Zobel says.

“Good luck having them remember.”

Other companies that make location tracking systems for senior living facilities, like the North Dakota-based ZulaFly, have similar features. ZulaFly’s systems can run location history reports on residents wearing tags, says managing partner Stephanie Andersen. Usually, it’s used to pass along information to family members about what their loved one did on a particular day. “Someone says, you know, my mom didn’t go to therapy or participate in activities,” Andersen says. “I can run a location history report and see how she spent her time.”

The same report can help with contact tracing. ZulaFly reached out to their customers (many of which are nursing homes) as COVID-19 case numbers started to climb in the US to remind them of the feature. “One replied and said they’d already been using it,” Andersen says. “It really does have everything they need to know the second someone tests positive.”

Health care company CenTrak has listed location history as one of the benefits of its location tracking systems for years, says Ari Naim, president and CEO. “But it was like, number 25, in terms of the list of benefits,” he says. “I have a feeling it’s going to go further up.”

Experts working in health services refer to older adults, who often have other chronic health conditions, as a “high-need, high-cost” group, Berridge says. “They’re set up in a way that calls for more data collection to protect them,” she says.

Arguments that call for using apps and digital systems to automate the contact tracing process lean on similar principles. A once-in-a-generation pandemic is a high-need event, during which public health is regularly weighted more heavily than personal privacy. If collecting personal information (like where someone has been and who they were with) can protect people, the risks seem more reasonable.

The contact tracing apps used for the general population aren’t fully analogous to the location monitoring systems used in nursing homes. They use Bluetooth, not real-time location services — so rather than follow where people go, the Bluetooth systems only track the other devices they were nearby. All of that information is (theoretically) unidentifiable. Users have to opt in, and the tech companies described the steps they took to make the data anonymous.

Nursing facility systems, on the other hand, are usually opt out, not opt in, Berridge says. They use real-time location tracking and tie that information to each person’s name.

They use real-time location tracking

It takes more and more detailed information on older adults living in nursing homes to get the benefits facilities are looking for. Knowing where residents are, at all times, helps staffers keep track of people with dementia. It helps them pinpoint someone’s location if they need help, and it can flag if an individual isn’t attending meals or activities, which could be a sign of a problem.

“It’s pretty darn useful if you’re in independent living, and you decide to go for a walk,” says Laurie Orlov, elder care advocate and founder of Aging in Place Technology Watch, which documents and analyzes trends in technology for older adults. A wearable that monitors location and can call for help is a valuable backup if someone slips or has health trouble. “If it’s night, and there’s ice, having a full detection capability that knows where you are is really useful,” she says.

The Missouri Slope long-term care facility started using the ZulaFly monitoring system in August 2018. It was a slow rollout, says LeAnn Hokanson, vice president of resident services. But it helps the facility keep track of people in the sprawling old building, which takes up multiple city blocks. “We wanted residents to be able to call for help more easily,” she says. “We tried to focus more on the positive aspects, and not as much on the tracking.”

CenTrak and CarePredict stress that the benefits of their systems make it worth the concessions to resident and staff privacy. Monitoring residents keeps them safer, and empowers the staff to provide personalized care, Wilmink says. The tools aren’t just tracking, Naim said, they have emergency call buttons as well. “It’s a very simple principle. That is, what is the value it provides, and what are you giving up,” he says.

Contact tracing apps created for the general population could add value as well: advocates say they could help flag interactions people don’t remember they had and take some of the burden off of the manual contact tracing workforce. Discussions of that value, though, have been secondary to conversations around privacy and consent. Apple and Google talked just as much, if not more, about privacy when they announced their Bluetooth-centered contact tracing tool.

The nursing home systems, which are more obtrusive, haven’t faced the same level of scrutiny

The nursing home systems, which are more obtrusive, haven’t faced the same level of scrutiny. That’s not surprising to Berridge. When it comes to technology like this, she says, there isn’t as much consideration to how the older adults they’re attached to might feel about it.

Berridge contributed to a survey of subject-matter experts, which is under review prior to publication, that evaluated risks and benefits of technology used in dementia care. She says experts were concerned about the amount of data the devices collect, the security of that data, and how that data was used. They also noted that, if the data showed evidence of high-risk behavior from residents or staff, that information could theoretically lead to increased health insurance premiums.

It may be that the benefits are worth the intrusions, Orlov says. “I think with fall detection, and anything that can help when you’re alone, the benefits exceed the cost of the privacy — assuming that you’re with it enough to opt in.”

Careful consideration of that question, though, has been slow to enter conversations around technology and senior care, Berridge says. When privacy is discussed, it’s often framed as a way to encourage people to use the tech. “It’s around acceptance — how do we get people to agree to use this?” she says.

Steven Kasch says his mother was uncertain about the CarePredict system, at first. She was used to being independent and said she didn’t see the need for it. But her memory loss made it important, Kasch says. “We just kept reiterating that it’s a safeguard, and it’s there to help you,” he says. “She’s warming up to it.” There’s similar carpeting and decor all through the different hallways at Legacy at Town Square, so it’s easy to get lost. The bracelet, and it’s call button, are there as a backup if she gets turned around.

“We sold it to her as safety,” Kasch says. Julia Kasch declined to be interviewed for this story.

It’s not uncommon for there to be gaps between how adult children and caregivers think about monitoring technology, and how the seniors they care for think about it, Berridge says. For caregivers, safety is critical. But older adults care a lot more about their privacy than many people give them credit for.

Berridge asked a group of homebound seniors who received Meals on Wheels how they felt about monitoring technologies like location trackers and cameras. She spoke to their adult children, who served as caregivers, separately. The gaps were clear: the caregivers were more supportive of the technology than the homebound parents were. Many caregivers said that they didn’t feel that they needed to involve their parents in the decisions to use the technology. “They grossly underestimated their parents’ ability to comprehend the basic functions of the technology,” Berridge says.

In fact, the seniors did understand the technology and had strong feelings about it. They said they behaved differently when tracking systems were watching them: they avoided sleeping in a chair because it may trigger an alarm, or they rushed in the bathroom because they don’t want the system to raise a flag if they were taking too long.

“You tend to hear people say, ‘Oh no, not for me.’”

It’s hard for caregivers to predict how they might feel if they were in the position their parents are in. Berridge does ask, though, if people think that they would be comfortable if there were trackers on them when they were in their 80s. “You tend to hear people say, ‘Oh no, not for me,’” she says. “It tends to be, no, I wouldn’t want that, or I realized that my mother would hate this, but I love having it for her.”

Monitoring systems are often sold as ways to help give older adults more freedom. They can go where they want, and if they run into trouble, someone can come and help them. But the power dynamics between seniors and their caregivers sometimes means that the technologies restrict, rather than enhance, freedoms. “You’re causing people to actually change their behavior, because it’s causing feelings of being controlled by the system,” Berridge says.

The power dynamics are amplified when monitoring systems are used for older adults with dementia or other cognitive impairments who often have caretakers making decisions for them. “We’re talking about others opting in on their behalf, and possibly without their permission,” Orlov, the elder care advocate, says. The oldest wearable tracking devices used to keep dementia patients from wandering off were based on lockdown technology invented for prisons, she says.

Even though the stated goal may be for safety, they have their roots in systems that were used on people who had no say in the matter — and should have extra scrutiny before they’re introduced. “You’re taking advantage of an individual who can’t give permission to your tracking and the way you’re going to track is something on their body,” Orlov says.

Emergencies, though, can push tricky ethical conversations to the side — and the COVID-19 pandemic has increased interest in this technology. The virus burned through senior care facilities around the country, and by one estimate in June, around 40 percent of the people who have died from the virus in the United States contracted it in a nursing home. For an added layer of protection for this and future disease outbreaks, many senior care facilities and nursing homes are newly interested in location tracking systems, the companies that make those products say.

CenTrak’s Naim says that they’ve seen an increase in orders for tracking tags since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. CarePredict is also seeing a surge in interest focused on its location tracking capabilities, Zobel says. It wasn’t the company’s original focus, but now it’s the main draw. They could envision the system being used for other infectious disease outbreaks in senior living facilities: outbreaks of highly contagious norovirus, which causes vomiting and diarrhea, are common in senior living facilities and nursing homes, for example.

“This is us hoping a little bit, but we think that the way this is going, some version of this is going to be standard operating procedures for them — they’re going to need a way to control these contagious diseases,” Zobel says.

However, they probably won’t be available to everyone. Nursing homes and care facilities with more resources will be the ones that can use them. Most care facilities — like the one Berridge’s grandfather lived in, for example — hardly have internet access. “They’re on the wrong side of the digital divide. Certain nursing homes are going to have more access to that contact tracing, and the help that provides during a crisis,” she says.

“It could be a false promise of something useful.”

It’s still not clear, though, how much they’d actually help. Like contact tracing apps, these location monitoring systems haven’t been used for infectious disease outbreaks before. Despite the marketing, Orlov isn’t sure how effective they’ll be. If nursing home residents in a place using the monitors are restricted to their rooms and not allowed to mingle, as many have been during the pandemic, there won’t be much from them to keep track of. “It could be a false promise of something useful,” she says. “It’s an opportunity for some companies to make a buck.”

Berridge worries that a rush to adopt these systems could distract from efforts to fill the gaps in infection control practices in nursing facilities. In March, staffers in around a third of facilities in the US weren’t able to demonstrate thorough handwashing, and a quarter weren’t using personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks properly. And that’s if they had access to equipment at all. Staffers in nursing homes are often low-paid and don’t have sick leave. “If we say, we think we have a solution to our contact tracing problem, yet we’re not providing PPE and we’re not adequately training staff and we’ve got major turnover issues, that’s a problem,” she says.

Even if wearables are more security theater than ways to prevent the spread of disease, they’re still appealing to nursing home management groups worried about the fallout from devastating COVID-19 outbreaks. Vendors can market to companies concerned that they’ll be sued for failing to protect residents, Orlov says. “They’re going to have to convince people to come there in the future.”

If Zobel’s prediction that these systems will become standard is correct, integration of location monitoring for older adults won’t be temporary. In the context of a crisis, scaling up some of these systems may make sense, Berridge says. “The extent to which this would continue beyond the crisis — and it probably would continue beyond this crisis — I think that’s a concern.” Meanwhile, Apple and Google, plan to disable their Bluetooth contact tracing system after the COVID-19 pandemic fades.

How much will it help? How invasive does it seem?

There are benefits and drawbacks to any new technology, and ideally, people affected by that technology can decide how much privacy they’re willing to give up for a potential benefit. Each time a new contact tracing app launches, the questions resurface: Is it actually worth it? How much will it help? How invasive does it seem? Then, they get to make a choice. “For the general public, it’s already hard,” Orlov says.

For older adults, it’s even harder. They might ask different questions about location monitoring than the general public, and they might balance out safety and privacy differently than other demographics. But they don’t tend to have the same opportunity to make a choice based on their values. The elderly tend to be a disempowered group, and their caregivers end up being the ones empowered to make decisions.

If and as location monitoring systems from older adults become more common, people involved in their adoption should have similar conversations around privacy and autonomy that swirled around contact tracing apps. Using them ethically is possible, and they could help keep people safe. But they can’t be introduced without real consideration of older adults’ autonomy.

“It’s not just privacy,” Berridge says. “It’s privacy paired with issues of power and control.”","['technology', 'location', 'care', 'privacy', 'senior', 'adopters', 'contact', 'tracing', 'systems', 'help', 'nursing', 'citizens', 'facilities', 'early']"

India’s health ministry reported 1,069 new Covid-19 deaths, bringing the official total to 100,842, though experts say the true toll is probably much higher. Until Saturday, only the United States and Brazil had reported more than 100,000 deaths from the virus.

At 6.4 million, India’s official caseload is the second-highest in the world, surpassed only by the United States, which has more than 7.3 million cases. India’s death and infection rates have climbed in recent months, with September alone accounting for more than 40 percent of its cases and about a third of its deaths.

The numbers have fallen somewhat since mid-September but remain high. Over the past week, India reported almost twice as many new cases as the United States did. And experts suspect that many Covid-19 fatalities in India have gone unreported.","['million', 'covid19', 'india', 'experts', 'toll', 'united', 'states', 'reported', '100000', 'deaths', 'official', 'death', 'passes', 'cases', 'indias']"

It is a micronutrient needed for metabolism, our sense of taste and smell and especially key during times of rapid growth, such as pregnancy, infancy, childhood, and puberty. Zinc deficiency is associated with impaired growth, slower wound healing and increased susceptibility to infections like the common cold.

“It’s very clear: If you are zinc deficient, your immune system will not function as well,” said Dr. David Hafler, professor of neurology and immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine.

Zinc’s importance wasn’t always so clear. In the 1960s, a hematologist named Dr. Ananda S. Prasad suspected that low levels of zinc hampered growth in humans. But when it came time for him to test his hypothesis by administering zinc to his growth-stunted patients in Egypt, he couldn’t find it anywhere. So he had capsules made from bottles of zinc sulfate, and then gave them to these young adults with dwarfism. “I couldn’t believe that an 19-year-old guy could gain over six inches in height,” said Dr. Prasad, of Wayne State University, who stressed that this was specific to nutritionally deficient populations. Though his findings were controversial at the time, his work helped lead the National Academy of Sciences in 1974 to declare zinc an essential element.

Today, sales of zinc supplement, in response to the pandemic, are projected to hit an estimated $134 million, according to Nutrition Business Journal.

As a disclaimer: Nutritional research is often flawed. It’s very unclear how a particular supplement or nutrient can directly affect our health. Why? Since we eat lots of different things, it’s difficult to determine cause and effect, or even influence, of a particular nutrient. So, reader, please approach what follows in that context.

Does zinc help with Covid-19?

There is absolutely no definitive evidence at this time that zinc can help with coronavirus.

Once again: “There is no scientific evidence that zinc or any vitamin or mineral or other dietary supplement can prevent or cure Covid-19,” said Carol Haggans, registered dietitian and consultant to the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Dietary Supplements.

The Food and Drug Administration has sent warning letters to five companies touting zinc products for the prevention, and treatment of the virus.

The World Health Organization said that more research is needed.

Does zinc help with the common cold?

It might.

Zinc lozenges may shorten a cold by about 33 percent, according to a meta-analysis of seven placebo-controlled clinical trials. That’s about two days for a cold that would last a week without treatment. But don’t wait until your nose has turned red to begin. If you would like to take zinc, do so within 24 hours of a cold’s onset — at first sniffle or cough. Though the proper dose has not been determined, the meta-analysis found a possible benefit when sucking on one lozenge every two hours while awake for a total of 75 milligrams or more daily.

Most of the research in this area has been done on lozenges, which are slowly released over a long period of time in the mouth. It is unclear whether pills and other forms of zinc that are swallowed may have the same benefit.

But we’re still not totally sure?

When pharmacist George Eby’s 3-year-old was undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia, he gave her zinc to boost her concentration of the mineral. At the time, she also happened to have a cold. Since she couldn’t swallow, she let it dissolve slowly in her mouth.

After her cold subsided, Dr. Eby worked with two other researchers and conducted the first randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial on the topic, which sparked a field of research that has had inconsistent results. The study only had 65 people.

While another systematic review and metanalysis in the Canadian Medical Association Journal also found a benefit of zinc supplementation, a number of other studies have not, including a new clinical trial.

Zulfiqar Bhutta, director of the Aga Khan University Institute for Global Health and Development, said the studies have been small, and narrow in focus. To gauge zinc’s effectiveness on the common cold, he said we need larger, placebo-controlled trials across geographies, in populations both zinc deficient and not.

Does zinc help with other ailments?

Zinc has been used topically to heal wounds since antiquity. The World Health Organization recommends that children with acute diarrhea take 20 milligrams of zinc for up to two weeks (10 milligrams for infants under six months).

Some previous indications of zinc’s benefit are not being confirmed in more recent studies. Beyond the gastrointestinal infections, Dr. Bhutta said his work with children who were micronutrient deficient did not find that zinc supplements significantly affected stunting, wasting and mortality. “We are also beginning to realize that many deficient populations have multiple micronutrient deficiencies and hence replacing just one nutrient doesn’t make sense, nor gives much benefits,” said Dr. Bhutta.

He is the senior author of a Cochrane Systematic Review that indicated zinc can help reduce both the prevalence and incidence of pneumonia among young children, many with underlying conditions such as H.I.V. infections. But he said recent data, not yet published, doesn’t bear that out in general populations.","['taking', 'supplement', 'dr', 'common', 'cold', 'help', 'zinc', 'research', 'deficient', 'health', 'populations']"

The next week is the critical phase in Trump’s illness. Here are the risks he faces. President Trump, 74, has contracted a virus that has posed a particular threat to older adults, particularly men. Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times President Trump’s positive coronavirus test has raised questions about what the infection could mean for the health of the leader of the United States. The president arrived at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday evening for what was expected to be a stay of a few days. His symptoms were described as a low-grade fever, nasal congestion and a cough, according to two people close to him. Mr. Trump may experience worse symptoms because of his failure to wear a mask, according to an expert at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. David A. Nace, a geriatrics expert and director of medical affairs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s network of 35 nursing facilities, said in an interview on Friday that people who don’t wear masks are exposed to higher concentrations of the virus, which can worsen the course of the disease. Here is what we know about how the virus could affect people fitting Mr. Trump’s profile. Older men are at greater risk of becoming seriously sick. Older men are up to two times as likely to die from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, as women of the same age, according to an analysis by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Another study, published in the journal Nature in August, found that the disparity was because men produce a weaker immune response than do women. Dr. Nace said that 5 to 15 percent of men in their mid-70s die from coronavirus, although Mr. Trump, who is 74, will obviously benefit from excellent medical care. And he said doctors know a lot more about how to treat Covid-19 now than they did early in the pandemic. There are a few possible avenues of treatment. “My big fear is that he probably had a greater exposure,” Dr. Nace said. He said Mr. Trump might be eligible for the drug remdesivir or perhaps convalescent plasma, both of which have received emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration for use as treatments. And he said doctors might also consider enrolling Mr. Trump in a clinical trial of monoclonal antibodies — laboratory-produced molecules that can stimulate the immune system, which does not mount as aggressive a response in people of Mr. Trump’s age. The president has received a dose of an experimental antibody cocktail being developed by the drug maker Regeneron, in addition to zinc, vitamin D and the generic version of the heartburn treatment Pepcid, according to a letter from his doctor that was released by the White House on Friday afternoon. One drug he would not give the president, Dr. Nace said, is hydroxychloroquine, which Mr. Trump touted as a “game changer” earlier in the pandemic. That drug can cause heart problems, Dr. Nace said, and in a disease like Covid-19, which can cause inflammation of the heart, “the risks are absolutely enormous.” Many people Mr. Trump’s age have recovered. Even though the risk of severe illness from Covid-19 increases with age, most people who contract it get well quickly with minimal symptoms. But it’s hard to say how long a recovery could take. Experts agree that the next week will be critical in determining the course of Mr. Trump’s illness. Charting a Coronavirus Infection Following the course of a typical Covid-19 case. Sui-Lee Wee and

Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters President Trump has received a dose of an experimental antibody cocktail being developed by the drug maker Regeneron, in addition to several other drugs, including zinc, vitamin D and the generic version of the heartburn treatment Pepcid, according to a letter from his doctor that was released by the White House on Friday afternoon. In the letter, Mr. Trump’s doctor, Dr. Sean P. Conley, said he “completed the infusion without incident” and that he “remains fatigued but in good spirits.” There are no approved treatments for Covid-19, but the Regeneron treatment is one of the most promising candidates. Initial results have suggested that it can reduce the level of the virus in the body and possibly shorten hospital stays — when it is given early in the course of infection. In an interview Friday afternoon, Regeneron’s chief executive, Dr. Leonard S. Schleifer, said Mr. Trump’s medical staff had reached out to the company for permission to use the drug, and that it was cleared with the Food and Drug Administration. “All we can say is that they asked to be able to use it, and we were happy to oblige,” he said. He said that so-called compassionate use cases — when patients are granted access to an experimental treatment outside of a clinical trial — are decided on a case-by-case basis and that Mr. Trump is not the first patient to be granted permission to use the treatment this way. “When it’s the president of the United States, of course, that gets — obviously — gets our attention.” Dr. Schleifer has known Mr. Trump casually for years, having been a member of his golf club in Westchester County.

My wife, Jill, and I pray that they’ll make a quick and full recovery. This is not a matter of politics. It’s a bracing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously. It’s not going away automatically. We have to do our part to be responsible — means following the science, listening to the experts, washing our hands, social distancing. It means wearing a mask in public and means encouraging others to do so as well. During a speech in Grand Rapids, Mich., Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, offered prayers for President Trump and the first lady. Credit Credit... Mark Makela for The New York Times Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, tested negative for the coronavirus on Friday, his campaign announced, and he later traveled to Michigan for an event there. “We wanted to make sure that we’re doing everything by the numbers,” a masked Mr. Biden said in Grand Rapids, adding that “everything is clear.” Mr. Biden sent his prayers to President Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump. “This is not a matter of politics,” he said. “It’s a bracing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously. It’s not going away automatically. We have to do our part to be responsible.” Earlier in the day, just hours after Mr. Trump revealed he had tested positive, Mr. Biden’s campaign released a statement from his doctor saying that Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, had both tested negative. Mr. Biden also shared the news on Twitter. “Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern,” he wrote. “I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands.” While Mr. Biden went ahead with his trip to Michigan, his wife, Dr. Biden, campaigned in New Hampshire, and she was scheduled to make several stops in Minnesota on Saturday. Mr. Biden appeared on the debate stage with Mr. Trump on Tuesday night. Eleven coronavirus cases have been tied to “pre-debate planning and setup,” according to a statement from the Cleveland mayor’s office, and “the majority of cases” affected out-of-state residents. It can take several days after exposure for the virus to reach levels that are detectable by a test. People show symptoms on average around five days after exposure, but as late as 14 days. Mr. Biden’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, also tested negative on Friday, the campaign said. Ms. Harris and Mr. Emhoff continued with planned campaign trips to Nevada and North Carolina, respectively. A virtual fund-raiser with Ms. Harris and former President Barack Obama also went ahead. “This virus is still very much active across our country, please continue to wear a mask and maintain social distancing,” Ms. Harris wrote on Twitter.

Pence, the next in line for the presidency, tests negative and will resume campaigning. Pelosi tests negative. Although there is a set presidential line of succession, the Constitution is unclear on determining whether a president can perform the duties of office. Credit... Erin Scott for The New York Times Vice President Mike Pence — the first in line to assume the Oval Office if President Trump becomes too ill to carry out his duties — tested negative for the virus on Friday. Mr. Trump was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday night. A White House spokesman said there were no plans to transfer the power of the presidency to Mr. Pence. The administration and the Trump campaign also said Friday that Mr. Pence “does not need to quarantine” and would resume campaign appearances, including at the vice-presidential debate against Senator Kamala Harris on Wednesday night. Jesse T. Schonau, Mr. Pence’s White House physician, said that the vice president “remains in good health and is free to go about his normal activities.” Mr. Pence, who has been campaigning separately from the president on Air Force Two, was last with him on Tuesday morning in Washington. Mr. Pence spent the day at his official residence at the Naval Observatory miles away from the White House, preparing for the debate, which is supposed to proceed as planned at the University of Utah, and filling in for Mr. Trump on a conference call. “I’m pleased to report President Trump and the first lady are both well at this time,” said the vice president. “They will remain at the White House while they convalesce.” By evening, Mr. Trump had departed for Walter Reed. The government’s continuity plan in case of a national emergency outlines who would take over if Mr. Trump became too ill to carry out his duties. The presidential line of succession, laid out in a 1947 law, falls first to Mr. Pence. After years of speculation that the vice president might succeed Mr. Trump after potential resignation or removal from office, Mr. Pence now finds the possibility of assuming presidential duties more plausible than ever, if his health holds up. Like the president, Mr. Pence has not always taken stringent precautions against the coronavirus. He has been photographed in public regularly without a mask, even after his press secretary, Katie Miller, tested positive in May. Mr. Pence was criticized in April for not wearing a mask while touring the Mayo Clinic. He defended his behavior by saying that he did not need to wear a mask because he was tested regularly. Should Mr. Pence’s health fail, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, would be next to step in. Ms. Pelosi tested negative, Drew Hammill, a spokesman, said Friday afternoon. After Ms. Pelosi, Senator Chuck Grassley, the president pro tem, would take up the mantle. Next in line is the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and after him is the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. (An earlier version of this article omitted the president pro tem.) Not since 1981, when Ronald Reagan was shot, has a president been known to confront a life-threatening ailment in office. Megan Specia and

White House rapid testing product is known to deliver incorrect results. The White House uses the Abbott ID Now rapid testing machine. Credit... Carlos Osorio/Associated Press For months, the White House’s strategy for keeping President Trump and his inner circle safe has been to screen all White House visitors with a rapid test. But the product they use, Abbott’s ID Now, was never intended for that purpose and is known to deliver incorrect results. In issuing an emergency use authorization, the Food and Drug Administration said the test was to be used only by a health care provider “within the first seven days of symptoms.” The ID Now has several qualities in its favor: It’s portable, doesn’t need skilled technicians to operate and delivers results in 15 minutes. Used to evaluate someone with symptoms, the test can quickly and easily diagnose Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. In people who are infected but not yet showing symptoms, however, the test is much less accurate, missing as many as one in three cases. In May, after many reports of problems with the test, the F.D.A. warned that those who test negative using the test should confirm that result with a lab-based test. Still, the Trump administration has routinely used the test to screen people without symptoms, allowing anyone who tested negative to go without a mask during meetings and official proceedings. The Rev. John I. Jenkins, president of the University of Notre Dame, tested positive for the coronavirus after attending the White House announcement of the Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, on Saturday. He apologized for going mask-free at the ceremony but said he was told he could do so after his rapid test came back with a negative result. Given the timing of Mr. Trump’s illness, experts said it is quite possible that he was exposed to the virus on Saturday.

Credit... Ruth Fremson/The New York Times On Saturday, President Trump met with Judge Amy Coney Barrett, the nominee to the Supreme Court, and others in the Oval Office. On Tuesday, he debated former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in an indoor hall, neither with a mask, talking at high volume and often without pause. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump traveled to and from Minnesota on Air Force One along with dozens of others. On Thursday, the president appeared indoors before hundreds of supporters at a golf club in Bedminster, N.J. On none of these occasions was the president wearing a mask. Often, neither were many in the room or on the airplane with him. All in all, conditions like these are a recipe for so-called superspreader events, in which a single infected person transmits the virus to dozens of others, research has shown. Experts may never know how the president was infected or whom he may have infected. The Rev. John I. Jenkins, president of the University of Notre Dame, tested positive for the coronavirus after attending a White House ceremony on Saturday for Judge Barrett. So did Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah. The timing raises the possibility that the president could have been infected over the weekend, scientists said. Most people develop symptoms about five days after being infected with the virus, so exposure over the weekend would fit with reports that the president was showing early symptoms on Wednesday and Thursday.

Jenkins, the University of Notre Dame president, tested positive for the virus after attending a White House ceremony without wearing a mask. Credit... Robert Franklin/South Bend Tribune, via Associated Press The University of Notre Dame announced on Friday that its president, the Rev. John I. Jenkins, had tested positive for the coronavirus, just days after he had publicly apologized for not wearing a mask or adhering to social distancing guidelines while at a White House ceremony over the weekend. “The positive test is a good reminder for me and perhaps for all of how vigilant we need to be,” Father Jenkins said in an email to Notre Dame students and staff. He also said that his symptoms were mild. The message sent by the university’s public affairs office to the Notre Dame community said Father Jenkins was “entering an extended period of isolation as indicated by University medical personnel and county health officials.” Father Jenkins had not worn a mask during the Supreme Court nomination ceremony on Saturday at the White House for Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who is a professor at Notre Dame, an event that increasingly looked like a possible source of spread. Father Jenkins said he was given a rapid coronavirus test upon arriving at the White House and was told that it would be safe to remove his mask after receiving negative results. Many other unmasked officials attended the ceremony, including Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, who announced on Friday that he, too, had tested positive for the coronavirus. Video posted on Twitter shows Mr. Lee hugging people at the event. He said he had tested negative at the White House on Saturday. Others in attendance included Alex M. Azar II, the health secretary; Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and an adviser to the president; and Attorney General William P. Barr. All three said they had tested negative, but it can take several days after exposure for the virus to reach levels that are detectable by a test. People show symptoms on average around five days after exposure, but as late as 14 days. Judge Barrett, 48, also tested negative on Friday, White House officials said. Notre Dame said that Father Jenkins, who is also a philosopher trained in theology and a member of Notre Dame’s philosophy department, had tested positive after he “learned that a colleague with whom he has been in regular contact tested positive for Covid-19.” Just weeks ago, Father Jenkins was chiding students and threatening to send them home for failing to abide by mask and distancing rules and putting the university in danger. He apologized for not following such guidance himself on Monday, and said that he had decided to quarantine “in an abundance of caution” after returning to the campus from the White House.

Pelosi suggests Trump’s positive test makes a stimulus deal more likely. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said President Trump’s positive test for the coronavirus could change the tenor of stimulus talks. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California expressed fresh optimism on Friday that a bipartisan deal for a broad coronavirus package could emerge out of her talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, floating the possibility that President Trump’s positive test for the coronavirus could change the tenor of the negotiations. “This kind of changes the dynamic, because here they see the reality of what we have been saying all along: This is a vicious virus,” Ms. Pelosi said on MSNBC. Her comments came the morning after Democrats muscled their latest, $2.2 trillion offer for a relief package through the House over unanimous Republican opposition, endorsing a wish list with little chance of enactment in a signal of the grim outlook for an agreement that could become law. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin spoke by phone Friday afternoon for about 65 minutes, during which “they discussed areas of disagreement,” said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi. “Their discussions will continue.” Ms. Pelosi was bullish on the talks earlier on Friday, insisting that she and Mr. Mnuchin would “find our common ground.” “We’re legislators,” she said. “We’ll get the job done.” Republicans have balked at Democrats’ relief plans, deeming them far too costly, but Mr. Trump’s diagnosis, coming on the heels of a grim jobs report, had the potential to change their political calculations, possibly jolting the White House and leading Republicans into a more compromising posture as they face strong political headwinds. Some members of Congress also began calling for more widespread testing of lawmakers and their staff members after Mr. Trump and Senator Mike Lee of Utah tested positive. As members left Washington to return to their districts they expressed concern about spreading the virus. “I really do think that there’s a strong possibility that every time we convene in a session, it has the potential to be a superspreader event,” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York. “We’re talking about 425 members of Congress coming from all over the country flying on planes coming here.” Representative Rodney Davis of Illinois, the highest-ranking Republican on the House Administration committee, called it a “travesty that we don’t have a testing modality system in place.” The House is not expected to be in session next week, despite concerns from moderate lawmakers about returning home to their districts ahead of Election Day without a stimulus deal in place. “It’s very disappointing,” said Representative Anthony G. Brown, Democrat of Maryland. “I’ve got constituents — you know, I’m right down the road in Prince George’s County, Maryland, and Anne Arundel, Maryland — whose businesses are shuttered, who have been furloughed for far too long. They need help.” Mr. Mnuchin presented Ms. Pelosi earlier this week with a $1.6 trillion counteroffer, the largest put forward by Republicans in months, but one that Ms. Pelosi rejected as inadequate.

Azar defends refusal of Trump family members to wear masks at the debate. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 0:55 - 0:00 transcript Azar Defends Trump Decision to Not Wear Mask At a House hearing on Friday, Alex M. Azar II, the Health and Human Services secretary, defended members of President Trump’s family for refusing to wear masks at the recent presidential debate. “I would ask you if there is any value to wear masks?” “Absolutely, we recommend it.” “So how do you describe or assess, or what is your reaction to the fact that the first family that was sitting at the political debate — presidential debate — were not wearing masks? Does that make your job more difficult?” “Our recommendations are always to wash your hands, watch your distance, wear a face covering when you can’t engage in social distance and avoid settings where you can’t do those three things. Now the first family, and the protective aspect around the president is a different situation than the rest of us because of the protocols around —” “No, no, no. Sir —” “But our recommendations —” “Reclaiming my time.” At a House hearing on Friday, Alex M. Azar II, the Health and Human Services secretary, defended members of President Trump’s family for refusing to wear masks at the recent presidential debate. Credit Credit... Michael A. Mccoy/The New York Times Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, defended members of President Trump’s family on Friday for refusing to wear masks at the recent presidential debate despite a requirement that the audience do so. The first family and the president are “in a different situation than the rest of us,” Mr. Azar said, because they are in a protective bubble. The first lady, Melania Trump, who was in the audience and has since tested positive, was among those who did not wear a mask. Mr. Azar’s comments came during a hearing of a special House committee overseeing the administration’s coronavirus response, where the secretary repeatedly ducked questions about the president’s conduct. Pushed by Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, he pointedly did not defend Mr. Trump’s campaign rallies. Instead he repeated his encouragement for Americans to wear masks and maintain social distancing. When Democrats urged the health secretary to acknowledge that the president’s own failure to wear masks set a bad example for the nation, Mr. Azar simply reiterated that his advice was for everyone to do so. Yet even as he spoke, the president’s science adviser, Dr. Scott Atlas, was seen outside the West Wing without a mask. One of the most withering attacks of the hearing came from Ms. Waters, whose sister died of Covid-19. “Are you proud of the job you have done?” she demanded. “I don’t like to speak in those terms; 206,000 people have died,” Mr. Azar replied. Earlier in the hearing, he was asked about a remark the president made about the pandemic’s toll, “It is what it is.” “We regret any loss of life,” Mr. Azar said. “Let’s be very clear about that. We wish we didn’t have this unprecedented coronavirus pandemic, but people do die in pandemics.”

As Fox grapples with multiple exposures, debate moderator Chris Wallace tells viewers to ‘wear the damn mask.’ “If I could say one thing to all of the people out there watching: forget the politics,” Chris Wallace said on Fox News. “This is a public safety health issue.” Credit... Ruth Fremson/The New York Times A son of Rupert Murdoch and some of the biggest stars at Fox News were potentially exposed to the coronavirus while attending Tuesday’s presidential debate in Cleveland, and the network is planning for its anchors, reporters and staff to be tested out of an abundance of caution, according to a person familiar with its plans. Chris Wallace, the Fox News anchor who sat within 12 feet of President Trump while moderating the debate, had some stark advice for his network’s viewers: “Wear the damn mask.” “Follow the science,” Mr. Wallace said, appearing Friday on “Fox & Friends” and other Fox News programs. “If I could say one thing to all of the people out there watching: forget the politics. This is a public safety health issue.” The anchor said he planned to take a coronavirus test on Monday on the advice of his doctors, who said that any infection could take several days to generate a positive result. Lachlan Murdoch, executive chairman of the Fox Corporation, led a toast to Mr. Wallace at a Cleveland airport after the event. The gathering included two of the channel’s news anchors, Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, along with the Fox News chief executive, Suzanne Scott, and the president of Fox News Media, Jay Wallace. Mr. Wallace then flew on a private plane to the Washington area in a group that included Mr. Baier and other Washington-based members of the Fox News staff. Several Fox News opinion hosts have accused much of the national news media of overstating the dangers of the virus. One frequent Fox News guest who played down the risks, Dr. Scott Atlas, has since become a top pandemic adviser to the president. On Friday, Mr. Wallace was unequivocal in warning against Dr. Atlas’s advice — even as his colleague, the Fox News anchor Sandra Smith, teased an exclusive interview with Dr. Atlas in which the doctor said he expected Mr. Trump would make a full recovery and return to the campaign trail. “I’m going to say something and, folks, I’m just trying to give you the truth,” Mr. Wallace said. “Dr. Scott Atlas is not an epidemiologist, is not an infectious disease expert — he has no training in this area at all. There are a number of top people on the president’s coronavirus task force who have had grave concerns about Scott Atlas and his scientific bona fides.” Recounting his experience at Tuesday’s debate, Mr. Wallace told viewers that members of Mr. Trump’s family had removed their masks after entering the debate hall in violation of the rules of the Cleveland Clinic, which had been contracted to oversee the health and safety protocols for the event. “A health person from the Cleveland Clinic came up to the first family when they were seated and offered them masks in case they didn’t have them, and they were waved away,” the anchor recalled.

Michigan Supreme Court strikes down Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s virus orders. Demonstrators gathered at the Michigan Capitol on Friday to protest Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s virus orders. Credit... Nicole Hester/Ann Arbor News, via Associated Press The Michigan Supreme Court on Friday struck down Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive orders issued over several months that were aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. In a 4-3 decision, the court ruled that she illegally drew authority from a 1945 law called the Emergency Powers of Governor Act that did not apply to the pandemic. “The governor did not have authority after April 30, 2020, to issue or renew any executive orders related to the Covid-19 pandemic,” the court wrote. Just hours before the decision was handed down, Governor Whitmer, a Democrat, had issued a fresh executive order rolling back the reopening of the state’s Upper Peninsula. The order restricts retail capacity, the size of social gatherings and requires schools to enforce mask requirements. That order drew authority in part from the 1945 law the court said does not apply. It was not immediately clear if the new order was enforceable. “Today’s Supreme Court ruling, handed down by a narrow majority of Republican justices, is deeply disappointing, and I vehemently disagree with the court’s interpretation of the Michigan Constitution,” Governor Whitmer said in a statement on Friday evening, adding that the ruling would not take effect for at least 21 days and that the existing orders would “retain the force of law” until then. Michigan officials reported 993 new cases and seven new deaths on Friday. There have been at least 140,057 cases and 7,110 deaths in the state since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a New York Times database.

Trump’s Secret Service has struggled with an outbreak at a training center. Secret Service agents at President Trump’s campaign rally at Wittman Airport in Oshkosh, Wis., last month. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times The Secret Service sustained a coronavirus outbreak at its training facility in Maryland in August, weeks before President Trump was infected, evidence of growing infections at the agency responsible for protecting the president. At least 11 employees at the center in rural Maryland tested positive for the virus even after it was closed for several months to mitigate transmissions, according to officials briefed on the matter. Some of the personnel are believed to have contracted the virus during training exercises or at a graduation celebration at a nearby hotel where participants did not practice social distancing, the people said. The agency declined to discuss the specifics of the outbreak, but it said in a statement that it “has taken significant precautions at its training center to protect the health and welfare of its trainees and training staff.” There is no indication that this outbreak led to infections among the agents and officers who directly protect the president. The details about the problem at the center were uncovered by the Project on Government Oversight, an independent watchdog group in Washington. The organization brought the information about the outbreak to The New York Times, which independently confirmed details of it with people briefed on the matter. Those people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing delicate personnel matters. The news early Friday morning that the president and the first lady had tested positive for the coronavirus gave the Secret Service outbreak new relevance. Hours before that announcement, the White House confirmed that Hope Hicks, a close adviser to Mr. Trump, had been infected. Zolan Kanno-Youngs and

Credit... Pool photo by Michael Reynolds The Pentagon said on Friday morning that there had been no changes to alert levels for American troops worldwide, and that military analysts had not detected any unusual activity from potential adversaries resulting from the announcement that President Trump had tested positive for the coronavirus. “There’s been no change to our alert levels,” the military’s Joint Staff said in a statement. “The U.S. military stands ready to defend our country and its citizens. There’s no change to the readiness or capability of our armed forces.” General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper were last with Mr. Trump on Sunday, an administration official said, at a reception for Gold Star families attended by both Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump. They are both getting tested, the official said. Mr. Esper was traveling in North Africa on Friday, while General Milley was at the Pentagon. As commander in chief, Mr. Trump can readily use secure communications channels to confer with top civilian Pentagon officials and military commanders while in quarantine at the White House, military officials said. Military officials tracking operations in the Middle East, Europe, Africa and the Pacific said they were monitoring for any possible increase in threats, but as of Friday morning had not detected any unusual activity.

Football’s leaders are trying to get coaches to wear masks after many broke the rules. The New England Patriots head coach, Bill Belichick, did not wear a mask while coaching the Patriots against the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday. Credit... Winslow Townson/Associated Press Football is grappling with a scourge of overt, if not always deliberate, violations of mask mandates among coaches and players. The N.F.L. has angrily watched some of its biggest names defy its rules. Most coaches in the Southeastern Conference, home to some of the best college teams, repeatedly breached the league’s policy during opening weekend, and college conferences are weighing how to police their stated protocols. The question is not easily solved in a sport that has long been politicized, that prizes its image as a haven for the macho and that sometimes lacks centralized governance. The N.F.L., which this week postponed the Steelers-Titans game because of an outbreak, has handed down at least $1.7 million in fines, and a top league executive warned coaches that penalties could escalate to suspensions or a loss of draft picks. There has been less urgency in the college ranks, where no coach or player has been publicly disciplined for violating masking policies. Although critics of mask rules have correctly noted that most games are outdoors and that players and coaches are regularly tested for the virus, officials believe that the coverings can still help curb the pathogen’s spread. Regular testing has detected outbreaks, but has not left teams immune to them. And the conspicuous breaches have revived questions about how closely athletic programs nationwide are following health rules. A recent survey of more than 1,200 college athletic trainers found that just 47 percent of coaches and staff members across sports were “fully compliant” with safety protocols related to the virus. The survey, conducted by the National Athletic Trainers’ Association, also found that roughly 7 percent of coaches and staff members did not follow the rules at all.","['oxygen', 'mr', 'took', 'presidents', 'treatment', 'president', 'coronavirus', 'house', 'virus', 'positive', 'white', 'trump', 'dropped', 'tested', 'steroid', 'levels', 'physician', 'trumps']"

Amazon finally released data on the number of coronavirus cases among its workforce, and it’s staggering: Nearly 20,000 U.S. employees have contracted the virus since March.

The e-commerce giant said in a blog post Thursday that between March 1 and Sept. 19, it counted 19,816 confirmed and presumed cases of covid-19, amounting to 1.44% of its roughly 1.37 million Amazon and Whole Foods Market front-line employees across the U.S. Though it should be noted that this total doesn’t include Amazon’s network of third-party delivery drivers that handles last-mile deliveries, a workforce numbered at 85,000 across the U.S., Canada, Spain, Germany, and the UK, according to the company’s previous statements. So that 19,000 tally is almost definitely a conservative estimate.

Lawmakers and labor groups have been asking Amazon for months to disclose stats on the spread of the virus among its employees following several concerning reports about unsafe working conditions. Following pressure from both the Senate and House of Representatives, the company finally implemented regular temperature checks and began offering workers basic PPE recommended by federal guidelines like face masks. In March, Amazon came under fire for reopening its Queens facility within a day after a worker there tested positive for covid-19. Hundreds of workers at Amazon and Whole Foods later coordinated “sick out” demonstrations to push for safer working conditions and protest the company’s firing of two employees who organized similar strikes.

In at least one instance, Amazon refused to tell local officials how many of its employees contracted the virus at one of its distribution centers. Amazon workers eventually banded together to attempt to track the spread of the virus themselves. According to their informal tally, nine employees have died from covid-19 so far. While the company didn’t provide updated figures in Thursday’s announcement, there have been eight confirmed Amazon worker deaths related to covid-19 this year.

Amazon previously avoided disclosing data on covid-19 cases by arguing that it would be misleading without other companies releasing similar figures (and it’s true—other leading retailers like Wal-Mart and Target have stayed tight-lipped on the subject). Amazon repeated that argument Thursday, stating that “[w]ide availability of data would allow us to benchmark our progress and share best practices across businesses and industries.”

Amazon added that the rate of infection among its workforce was 42% lower than expected compared to the national average. If Amazon’s infection rate matched the “general population rate” of cases in the U.S., the company said it would have seen almost 34,000 cases.

In addition to these stats, Amazon also reiterated that its conducting thousands of covid-19 tests per day. By November, it expects to grow to 50,000 tests a day across its 650 facilities “as part of our effort to keep our front-line employees safe.”","['rate', 'employees', 'covid19', 'virus', 'nearly', '20000', 'workforce', 'contracted', 'workers', 'data', 'day', 'amazon', 'cases']"

Can man’s best friend lend a hand, or a nose, to the fight against the novel coronavirus? The answer might be yes.

There are various ongoing efforts to train sniffer dogs to detect covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus. If dogs prove to be reliable in detecting the virus, scientists believe that they could provide low-cost, fast and reliable screening. Dogs would no doubt be an important help to their human friends, especially considering the testing problems that have been experienced in many parts of the world, including the U.S.

While we explain how sniffing out covid-19 might work, let us introduce you to Floki, an English springer spaniel in Australia. Floki is currently taking part in covid-19 detection training with researchers from the University of Adelaide.","['dogs', 'taking', 'detection', 'covid19', 'spaniel', 'detect', 'learning', 'reliable', 'english', 'springer', 'floki', 'training', 'dog']"

When the board added a September test date for the first time in decades, more than 334,000 students registered to take it on Saturday.

But again, many were thwarted; four out of 10 testing centers, mostly in the Northeast and California, remained closed on Saturday, a decision that the College Board said is made by local administrators, based on conditions in their communities. (The rival ACT has faced similar disruptions; nearly a third of its centers were closed for the Sept. 19 testing date.)

To try to avoid that risk, some determined test takers traveled many miles from home. Ava Pallotta, 16, a high school senior in New Rochelle, N.Y., had registered for the March and June test dates, but both were canceled. So for this weekend, she picked a spot in Albany, about two hours away, and drove there Friday night to sleep at her grandmother’s place.

“I can’t give myself a break,” said Ava, “because I’ve been so concerned about this deadline that keeps getting pushed back.”

Although testing centers in New York City and other major metro areas are often packed, those in suburban and rural areas generally have spots available, a split that exacerbates the inequities inherent in admissions testing. The College Board said less than 10 percent of its testing sites across the country were full on Saturday.

That’s how I wound up at Sleepy Hollow High School, which drew students from New York City and across its suburbs, along with locals. (I didn’t register for the test until the last possible day, and did so at a site far from my home in Brooklyn that still had vacancies, to avoid taking a spot from a student that wanted it.)","['testing', 'face', 'registered', 'mask', 'test', 'york', 'spot', 'students', 'school', 'pencils', 'board', 'college', 'centers']"

Mercedes have won the drivers' and constructors' titles in each of the past six Formula 1 seasons

A second Mercedes team member has tested positive for coronavirus at the Eifel Grand Prix.

The entire team was re-tested after one positive result on Thursday and a third person delivered an inconclusive result and is being tested again.

In total, six staff members have had to go into isolation under Formula 1's Covid-19 protocols because of the positive tests.

Mercedes have flown in six replacement team members from the UK to Germany.

None of the people involved are a ""known person"" in F1 terminology, meaning a team figure with a public profile.

The team refused to identify the people involved for reasons of data protection and medical confidentiality.

On Thursday, after the first positive test was revealed, Lewis Hamilton said he was ""concerned"" and ""sad"" and emphasised the need to behave appropriately to avoid Covid-19.

""It is important for everyone around the world to be continually reminded this thing has not disappeared. It is still here,"" he said.

""We still have to follow protocols, wear masks, keep your hands clean and keep your distances.

""I can't say what it will do to our weekend. We have a lot of great people in the team, we will just try to make him proud and it will take a lot of work to make sure we continue on without any disturbances.""

The F1 season resumed in July with an extensive set of protocols in place to minimise the risk of personnel contracting coronavirus.

These include keeping teams away from each other, and operating within teams using a series of 'bubbles', regular testing, and mandatory mask wearing in the paddock.

Last week, F1 announced the highest number of positive tests in a week since the season resumed, with 10 personnel involved with the sport contracting the virus in the wake of the Russian Grand Prix.

Local restrictions are looser in Russia than in many countries in western Europe, with the locals generally not wearing masks or practising social distancing.

A number of European countries are facing a fresh rise in coronavirus cases, including the UK, where Mercedes' chassis and engine factories are located.

Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said: ""The drivers are the most restricted of the whole group, of the whole team. It's certainly not a great situation for them because you almost need to live like a hermit and that's what they are doing.

""They are at home, they are not going out for dinners, they are not meeting any other people. Within the team when we do the debriefs by Zoom or Microsoft Teams, they are not sitting with the engineers in the room.

""They are sitting in their own rooms and we are avoiding as much as possible any personal contact with them. It's literally stepping into the car and driving the car and keeping their distance.""

Only one driver has tested positive so far this season, Racing Point's Sergio Perez.

The Mexican contracted coronavirus in July after travelling back to his home country to visit his mother after she had been in hospital.

He missed two races, the British Grand Prix and 70th Anniversary GP at Silverstone, but returned for the subsequent event in Spain.","['member', 'protocols', 'mercedes', 'positive', 'covid19', 'season', 'eifel', 'f1', 'tested', 'second', 'grand', 'tests', 'involved', 'formula', 'team', 'teams', 'prix']"

Another study, published in Nature in August, found that this was because men produce a weaker immune response than do women.

President Trump tests positive for Covid-19, and the country plans for an uncertain future

Late last night, President Trump tweeted that he and Melania had tested positive for Covid-19. Hours earlier, the White House had announced that Hope Hicks, a trusted aide of the president, had also tested positive. The president has gone into quarantine with the first lady, and a memorandum from his physician noted that both are doing well. Still, everyone is wondering what will happen if he gets seriously sick, not least because three of the things known to make this disease riskier are being male, old, and overweight. Stocks have fallen since news of the president’s diagnosis broke. Both Joe Biden and Mike Pence have tested negative, but tracing all of the president’s contacts will be a Herculean task.

This development throws into relief the president’s refusal to take this virus seriously and the impact that has had on national planning, or lack thereof. Nine months after the first known coronavirus case in the US, researchers are attempting to put together a plan for a comprehensive, nationwide response in the absence of one from the federal government. And while numerous vaccines are in Phase III trials—a significant achievement in its own right—slight differences in trials and no head-to-head comparisons mean that there are still a lot of unknowns. Even so, as Anthony Fauci told WIRED’s Steven Levy earlier this week, there is reason to be optimistic: “This outbreak will end.”

New developments in tracing, testing, and how to think about stopping the spread of Covid-19

Earlier this week, New York and New Jersey became the latest states to release voluntary contact-tracing apps. The apps protect users’ privacy by identifying them with a random sequence of numbers that changes every few minutes, and they will notify people when they have been in contact with someone who’s tested positive. There’s still much to learn about how SARS-CoV-2 spreads, but nine months of epidemiological data have shown that it tends to spread in clusters. Some infected people barely spread it at all, while others are single-handedly responsible for soaring numbers. Thus far, contact-tracing apps haven’t done much to stop the spread of Covid-19 in the US, as different states coordinate patchwork responses and the federal government doesn’t weigh in.

Of course, contact tracing of any kind can only be effective if tests are available and results are returned quickly. As many Americans continue to get test results back too late to be useful, a new House bill introduced by Mikie Sherrill (D-New Jersery) would increase federal reimbursements to labs depending on how quickly they turn around Covid-19 test results. The aptly named SPEEDY Act will offer graduated reimbursements for results coming back in 24, 48, or 72 hours, and won’t pay at all for those that take more time. Bill Gates had suggested a similar plan in an interview with WIRED this summer. While it is well established that an effective testing apparatus is a prerequisite for getting this pandemic under control, ultimately the only thing that will stop the virus’s spread is how people behave.

Nothing is certain. Among the nearly eight million coronavirus cases and 215,000 deaths in the United States, colleges and universities account for at least 178,000 infections and 70 deaths, according to a New York Times analysis. Outbreaks have postponed several college football games and sidelined entire teams, leaving colleges scrambling to patch together their seasons.

On Wednesday, the Southeastern Conference postponed a showdown between No. 10 Florida and Louisiana State, the defending national champion, because of a virus outbreak on the Gators’ roster. Hours later, Alabama Coach Nick Saban, one of the most powerful figures in college sports, said he had tested positive, too.

Even the N.F.L., with fewer variables than a college football team — smaller rosters, bigger budgets and no requirement to attend classes — has found itself unable to keep the virus out of its locker rooms.

The big fear, beyond a team outbreak that could spread across campus and beyond, is the death of a player. At least two have died from the virus already.

Cal and the Pac-12, eager to swim with other top conferences that are deep into their seasons, collecting attention and revenue, are just now wading into these daunting waters. During the summer, the Pac-12 had said it would delay football until 2021. But then came the Hail Mary of daily rapid-result antigen testing, through a deal with Quidel, a diagnostic health care company based in San Diego.

That is how practice begins at Cal these days. Football players come to Memorial Stadium, head upstairs to the outdoor concourse near where fans would normally line up to buy hot dogs, and stick a swab deep into their own nostrils.

In the tweet, the president said he had “A total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday. That means I can’t get it (immune) and can’t give it. Very nice to know!!”

Even with the label, the tweet is still available for those who click through the warning, in keeping with Twitter’s position that keeping tweets from elected officials visible is in the public interest. And attempts to share the tweet bring up an alert that reads “We try to prevent a Tweet like this that otherwise breaks the Twitter Rules from reaching more people.” The labeled tweet is still able to be quote-tweeted, however.

The president’s assertion that he’s now “immune” since he already contracted the coronavirus is likely what got the tweet flagged, since there have been documented cases of coronavirus patients becoming reinfected. A man in Nevada had COVID-19 in March then recovered in April only to fall ill again in May. The first documented case of a coronavirus reinfection occurred in Hong Kong, where the patient showed no symptoms the second time around.

Related A case of coronavirus reinfection shows the complexities of the pandemic

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website has limited information about reinfections, but says “a person who has had and recovered from COVID-19 may have low levels of virus in their bodies for up to 3 months after diagnosis,” and that the science “does not imply a person is immune to reinfection” from the virus.

A Twitter spokesperson said it was not the first time the platform has disabled sharing on a tweet by the president containing incorrect information. In addition to updating its policies last month that it would label or remove tweets with false information about election rigging and results, Twitter also said it would label posts from candidates prematurely declaring victory. And Twitter said back in March that it was taking a “zero-tolerance approach” to coronavirus misinformation on its platform.

Last week’s updates further tightened the rules around spreading misinformation, and encouraged people to quote-tweet and “add their own commentary” to tweets before retweeting someone. The update also included plans to flag or remove tweets meant to incite interference in the election or election results, and tweets from political figures with more than 100,000 followers — which includes President Trump — labeled as “misleading” are now more difficult to access

Twitter has labeled several of Trump’s tweets for violating its policy on manipulated media and civic and election integrity for tweeting falsehoods about mail-in voting.

What we know about coronavirus as cases climb once again

This week the virus continued to surge throughout much of the United States and Europe. Yesterday, several European countries, including Italy and Austria, reported their highest single-day cases. And stateside, it was the first day with more than 70,000 new cases since the summer, as 32 states reported rising rates of infection.

While the subject of how and whether to reopen schools remains controversial, experts say that so far there’s little to suggest that reopened schools are contributing to these surges. And though infections are rising, Covid-19 death rates have plummeted, an indication that doctors are getting better at caring for patients even in the absence of a definitive cure or treatment.

We also know much more about how the virus spreads than we did in the pandemic’s early days. While it can linger on surfaces, mounting evidence shows that you’re far less likely to catch it from touching something than you are from neglecting to social distance. Earlier this week, the CDC modified its guidelines to reflect research showing one can contract coronavirus from multiple brief encounters. The agency now defines a “close contact” as spending a cumulative 15 minutes or more within 6 feet of an infectious person over a period of 24 hours.

A vaccine advances as America’s first treatment is greenlit

Yesterday, Moderna announced that it had enrolled all 30,000 participants in its Phase III vaccine trial. More than a third are minorities and a quarter are over the age of 65 in an attempt to reflect the diversity of the general population. The company expects to have early data about the efficacy of its vaccine in the next month. During a daylong meeting with FDA officials the same day, some vaccine experts urged the agency to request more than the requisite two months of safety data before approving vaccines.

The FDA has also moved forward with remdesivir as the first—and only—fully approved drug for treating Covid-19 in the US. The drug was granted emergency use authorization in May, and has been approved or authorized for temporary use in around 50 countries. Now, it can be used for any hospitalized Covid-19 patient in the US who’s at least 12 years old. This news comes approximately a week after a massive international trial found that remdesivir does not prevent deaths among patients with severe cases with Covid-19. The research has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a journal, and some have disputed its conclusiveness. But the trial’s sheer size suggests that the data are still significant.","['surge', 'coronavirus', 'covid19', 'treatment', 'virus', 'progress', 'data', 'vaccine', 'week', 'trial', 'cases']"

It’s going to be a while before air travel returns to anything resembling what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. And after seven months of restrictions on international travel, many people are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to board an international flight. This doesn’t just include vacationers who had to postpone their dream trip because of COVID—the limitations on international flights have also posed challenges to those who travel for business, or to visit family in another country.

Now, a new pilot program giving passengers the opportunity to upload their COVID-related health data, is being tested by two major airlines as a way to potentially facilitate international travel during the pandemic. Here’s what you need to know about the so-called “COVID passports.”

What are COVID passports?

Starting back in April, there has been talk of using “immunity passports” to enable international travel. Initially, the idea was to issue some type of documentation to people who have developed immunity to SARS-CoV-2, but as we learned more about the virus, it became evident that it didn’t follow the typical trajectory of recovery. At this point, it’s still unclear whether everyone who had COVID-19 will achieve some type of immunity, and if so, how long it will last. There are also plenty of legal and ethical challenges with that type of system.

To be clear: the newly announced COVID passports take a different approach: Instead of providing proof of immunity, they function as a “digital health pass,” where passengers can provide certified COVID-19 test results to border agents when they arrive in a different country, AFAR reports. They are called CommonPass, and were developed by the Swiss-based nonprofit the Commons Project and the World Economic Forum. So far, the organization has presented their idea to at least 37 countries.

“Travel and tourism has been down across the board due to the COVID pandemic,” Diane Sabatino, deputy executive director of field operations for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) told AFAR. “CBP wants to be part of the solution to build confidence in air travel, and we are glad to help the aviation industry and our federal partners [start up] a pilot like CommonPass.”

At this point, United Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways have started testing the CommonPass, offering it as an option to passengers on select flights between London and New York and between Hong Kong and Singapore.

How does CommonPass work?

Basically, it requires a lot of steps and international cooperation. We’ll let Michelle Baran at AFAR explain it:

Each participating country must decide on two things—first, which COVID-19 tests and lab results are deemed credible. For instance, in the United States, the current standard required by states such as Hawaii has become a PCR test (also known as the nasal swab test) administered by a lab certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Secondly, each government must determine what its entry requirements are. Once those are established, the CommonPass creates a digital network with certified labs so travelers’ results can be uploaded to the platform. And when travelers enter their destination, they are given the entry requirements they need to fulfill. After travelers take a COVID-19 test at a certified lab and upload the results to their mobile phone, they can then complete any additional health questionnaires required by the destination country. CommonPass confirms compliance and generates a QR code that can be scanned by airline staff and border officials either from a mobile device or one that has been printed out.

The current trials are a very important part of the process, giving passengers, airlines, and border agents the chance to see how they work from start to finish.

How do you know if CommonPass is right for you?

First of all, unless you’re scheduled to fly on one of the selected United Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways, this isn’t something you have to make your mind up about today, as we’re not to the point of it being standard practice. For now, those participating in the trial run aren’t exempt from any government travel restrictions, like a mandatory quarantine. Though that may change in the future, for now, you’ll have to follow the same rules as everyone else.

“Without the ability to trust COVID-19 tests—and eventually vaccine records—across international borders, many countries will feel compelled to retain full travel bans and mandatory quarantines for as long as the pandemic persists,” Dr. Bradley Perkins, former chief strategy and innovation officer at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told AFAR. Perkins—who is now chief medical officer at the Commons Project—notes that having an international digital health information-sharing platform like CommonPass could be the key to reopening borders.

Testing concerns

At this stage, we’re still multiple steps away from this becoming a reality, including countries around the world coming to an agreement on which COVID-19 tests and results are considered credible. It’s also important to remember that right now, COVID tests only provide information for a particular snapshot in time regarding whether or not a person is infected with the virus. Turning it over to Lifehacker’s Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki to explain:

A person can have the coronavirus and still test negative. This may be because they got a false negative result. Among the possible reasons why: maybe the swab didn’t pick up enough viral RNA, or maybe the person is in the very early stages of the infection when it’s harder to detect. The FDA notes in a fact sheet on PCR testing that, “a negative result does not rule out COVID-19 and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions. A negative result does not exclude the possibility of COVID-19.”

Using COVID tests as a means to reopen international borders is putting a lot of faith in a process that has yet been perfected.

Data concerns

You may also be wondering what happens to all of your personal health information collected and stored in CommonPass. According to The Commons Project, their framework will “allow individuals to access their lab results and vaccination records, and consent to have that information used to validate their COVID status without revealing any other underlying personal health information.”

Advertisement

Passengers would be able to access their lab results and vaccination records through existing health data systems, national or local registries, or personal digital health records (Apple Health for iOS, CommonHealth for Android). The Commons Project also claims that “Apple Health and CommonHealth let individuals store their health records securely and privately on their phones, entirely under their control.”

Though it may take a while to roll out a system like this, understanding how it’s supposed to work is an important first step in deciding whether CommonPass would be something you’d want to try.","['covid', 'covid19', 'airports', 'international', 'passports', 'test', 'commonpass', 'tests', 'know', 'health', 'lab', 'travel', 'results', 'offered']"

If analysts from BloombergNEF are right, then all of the world’s most greenhouse gas polluting days are behind it, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A sharp drop in energy demand caused by the global response to the coronavirus pandemic will remove 2.5 years of energy sector emissions between now and 2050, according to the latest New Energy Outlook from BloombergNEF.

The latest models from the analysis firm tracking the evolution of the global energy system show that emissions from fuel combustion will likely have peaked in 2019.

The company’s models show that global emissions declined roughly 20% as a result of the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and while those emissions will rise again with economic recoveries, BloombergNEF’s models never see emissions reaching 2019 levels. And from 2027 emissions are projected to fall at a rate of 0.7% per year to 2050.

These rosy projections are based on the assumption of a massive construction boom for wind and solar power, the adoption of electric vehicles and improved energy efficiency across industries.

Together, wind and solar are projected to account for 56% of global electricity generation by mid-century, and along with batteries will gobble up $15.1 trillion invested in new power generation over the next 30 years. The firm also expects another $14 trillion to be invested in the energy grid by 2050.

The rain on this new energy parade could come from India and China, which have long been reliant on coal power to keep their national economies humming. But even in these colossal coal consumers the Bloomberg report sees good news for people who like good news.

They expect coal-fired power to peak in China in 2027 and in India in 2030. By 2050, coal is projected to account for only 12% of global electricity consumption. But even with the surge in renewables, gas-fired power ain’t dead. It remains the only fossil-fuel to continue to grow until 2050, albeit at an anemic 0.5% per-year.

No one should break out the champagne based on these projections, though, because the current trajectory still sees the globe on a course to hit a 3.3 degrees Celsius rise in temperature by 2100.

“The next ten years will be crucial for the energy transition,” said Bloomberg New Energy Finance chief executive, Jon Moore. “There are three key things that we will need to see: accelerated deployment of wind and PV; faster consumer uptake in electric vehicles, small-scale renewables, and low-carbon heating technology, such as heat pumps; and scaled-up development and deployment of zero-carbon fuels.”

And a three degree rise in temperature is bad. At that temperature huge swaths of the world would be unlivable because of widespread drought, rainfall in Mexico and Central America would decline by about half, Southern Africa could be exposed to a water crisis and large portions of nations would be covered by sand dunes (including chunks of Botswana and a large portion of the Western U.S.). The Rocky Mountains would be snowless and the Colorado River could be reduced to a stream, according to this description in Climate Code Red.

“To stay well below two degrees of global temperature rise, we would need to reduce emissions by 6% every year starting now, and to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C, emissions would have to fall by 10% per year,” Matthias Kimmel, a senior analyst and co-author of the latest report, said in a statement.","['covid19', 'projected', 'global', 'wind', 'peaked', 'models', 'rise', 'temperature', 'coal', 'techcrunch', 'thanks', 'emissions', '2019', 'energy', 'power']"

Tweets that violate this policy will need to be removed, Twitter said Friday. However, it also clarified that this does not automatically mean suspension. Several news outlets misreported that users would be suspended automatically. Of course, that doesn’t mean users won’t be suspended.

Motherboard reported that users would be suspended, citing a statement from Twitter. That runs slightly counter to Twitter’s public statement on its own platform.

San Francisco and Alameda counties have stopped using Verily, Google’s health-focused sister company, to test for the novel coronavirus, Kaiser Health News reported on Monday.

Verily launched a pilot covid-19 testing program earlier this year and scored $55 million in contracts with California state to set up both mobile and stationary test sites (it’s also part of Rite Aid’s $120 million-plus contract with the Department of Health and Human Services). What quickly became clear is that Verily’s services weren’t geared towards filling the needs of communities especially vulnerable to the pandemic: people of color, those with low income, and the homeless.

San Francisco and Alameda counties apparently dropped Verily for two primary reasons: concerns that Verily was using coronavirus testing to gather health information on patients, and the impression wealthier communities were receiving resources originally intended for low-income, Black, and Latino ones. Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, which falls in Alameda County, and other officials on a racial disparity task force wrote a letter to state Secretary of Health Mark Ghaly in June warning Verily’s services fell short of expectations.

In the letter, Schaaf and other officials wrote that Verily did not allow appointments to be made by phone and required users input their own information through its Project Baseline portal, making it difficult for “less tech-savvy users” or those without smartphones or stable internet access to use. Verily was also only available in English and Spanish, and users who receive negative test results can only receive that information by logging back onto the portal, they added.

The letter also noted that Verily’s privacy policies technically allow for sharing of user data with a large number of other entities:



Per the privacy policies, personal data can be shared with “Verily’s contractors… the entity that is operating the site and its contractors, the state Department of Public Health and potentially other federal, state, and local health authorities, and other entities that assist with the testing program.” This exposes vulnerable community members to widespread sharing of personal data that could be used for commercial or other purposes.

G/O Media may get a commission Sony WH-1000XM4 $218 at Backmarket Use the promo code Kinja2020

As previously noted by Gizmodo, Verily’s Project Baseline was originally designed to “contribute to the map of human health and participate in clinical research.” There’s no concrete guarantee that the pharmaceutical companies running clinical trials through Project Baseline will keep any of that data quiet, and Verily reserves the right to use collected data for “commercial product research and development” and compile it in a “de-identified data set.” Verily told Gizmodo there were a number of privacy controls on data related to its covid-19 testing program, but stopped short of stating outright that none of it would be used for commercial purposes.

Those aren’t the only issues Schaff and the task force brought up. Verily also mislabeled a test site in Oakland as drive-thru for over a month, and many of those showing up for testing through the portal were from different zip codes; there were reportedly wait times of a week or more for test results.

Advertisement

Per Kaiser, Verily had two sites in Oakland, one of which shut in May and the other of which is expected to “reopen using a different testing vendor.”

Dr. Noha Aboelata, CEO of East Oakland clinic Roots Community Health Center, told the site that she partnered with Verily to run a test site but asked it to leave after just six days. In addition to the issue with the mislabeled drive-thru capability, patients who signed up for Verily tended to be white and arrive from wealthier neighborhoods, while walk-ins tended to be people of color. Aboelata told Kaiser that data showed just 1.5% of the people in the Verily line were testing positive for the virus, as opposed to nearly 13% of walk-ins. She added that many of the latter group were wary of signing over health data.

“That always is going to raise suspicion and concern in our community...from where we sit, this is an old story,” Aboelata told Kaiser. “Corporations that are not really invested in the community come helicoptering in, bearing gifts, but what they’re taking away is much more valuable.”

Verily mobile testing clinics in San Francisco County have been sidelined with no official explanation, Kaiser reported, but multiple sources told the site “the Verily registration process proved chaotic for homeless people and others in the Tenderloin district, one of the city’s poorest neighborhoods.” Dr. Jonathan Fuchs, testing strategy lead for the county health department, told the site the department’s Verily program was “currently on hold.”

Science is moving at a rapid pace to respond to the novel coronavirus pandemic. In recent months, researchers have developed tests to detect covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, using different substances such as s aliva. Now, there’s apparently another substance that can tell us whether someone has covid-19, sputum, commonly known as phlegm.

Researchers at the University of Tehran have developed a test they say is capable of detecting the virus in phlegm. The test uses an electrochemical diagnostic system, also developed by the researchers, to detect reactive oxygen species —unstable molecules that contain oxygen and whose build-up can damage RNA, DNA and proteins and cause cell death — produced by respiratory inflammation. The system is called the ROS Detector in Sputum Sample.

In a recent interview with IEEE Spectrum, Mohammad Abdolahad, an associate professor at the College of Engineering at the University of Tehran, said there are currently no widely available, reliable and fast testing methods for the virus, which he considers a crucial tool for stopping its spread. Results for molecular tests, which are considered highly accurate by the U.S. F ood and Drug Administration, can take a day or up to week. Antigen tests, also known as rapid tests, offer results in an hour or less, but are not as accurate . (The FDA says that negative results may need to be confirmed with a molecular test).

Abdolahad led a team of undergraduate and postdoctoral candidates at the university in the development of the test and system.

“Consequently, we have developed a fast method to screen for respiratory inflammation [in] real-time,” Abdolahad told the outlet. “The test can also help inform doctors if the patient has an increased chance of contracting COVID-19. Respiratory diseases can make a patient immunoresistant and by being diagnosed, the patient now knows that she needs to take additional steps in order to protect herself against coronavirus.”

In order to get tested, a person must cough to generate phlegm. While this may sound easy—god knows I’m always hacking it up when I have a cold—it’s more complicated than it seems.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in order to produce a good phlegm sample, you have to first take a few deep breaths while pressing your hand lightly on your stomach. When you cough, the CDC says that you should be inhaling so deeply that you feel it in your stomach. This is almost like practice. Then, you rinse out your mouth with water and spit it out (we don’t want mouth bacteria in the sample). Once you spit, it’s time to put your hand over your stomach and cough again, deeply, into the container provider. Per Abdolahad, in this case the container is a falcon tube.

Each individual tube is tested using a probe with a disposable sensor, made with multi-wall carbon nanotubes , that’s connected to an integrated monitor, he told IEEE Spectrum. The sensor is calibrated according to the presence and severity of covid-19 in patients. The results are displayed on the monitor in 30 seconds.

Calibrating the sensor to correlate with the presence and severity of covid-19 was one of the first challenges the researchers faced, Abdolahad said. To understand the differences between covid-19 and other respiratory diseases, the researchers tested more than 100 people.

“We found that in some respiratory illnesses, such as asthma and acute pneumonia, there is an increase in ROS. Seasonal inﬂuenza on the other hand induces a reduction in ROS levels [in the] immune system and suppresses certain bacterial clearance,” Abdolahad said.

The ROS Detector in Sputum Sample system is being used in four hospitals as a non-invasive, real-time complementary tool for further observational clinical trials, according to IEEE Spectrum. It has received a temporary certificate from the Iranian Food and Drug Administration, which allows the researchers to sell their technology to medical centers. The researchers have also applied for a U.S. patent, but have not received news on their application yet, the outlet reported.

T he UK is considering a controversial approach to testing potential vaccines for the coronavirus that causes covid-19: intentionally exposing volunteers to the virus, in a strategy known as challenge trials.

Advertisement

Last week , the Financial Times reported that the UK government will allow human challenge vaccine trials to begin by January 2021. In these trials, volunteers would b e given an experimental vaccine and then later exposed to the coronavirus in a controlled setting. These trials, advocates say, will speed up the development of covid-19 vaccines, though other experts have worried about the potential health risks to volunteers.

At this point, however, the status of these trials still appears to be in flux. A spokesperson for the UK’s Department for Business, Enterprise and Industrial Strategy said in a statement to Gizmodo : “We are working with partners to understand how we might collaborate on the potential development of a COVID-19 vaccine through human challenge studies.”

Last Thursday, the pharmaceutical company Open Orphan, which the Financial Times reported will be involved in running these trials, sai d that it was in “advanced negotiation” with the UK government and other partners to begin these trials but that there “can be no certainty that these discussions will lead to a new contract until final negotiations are concluded.”

A representative for another reported partner, the Imperial College London, declined to comment on the report specifically, telling Gizmodo via email that “Imperial continues to engage in a wide range of exploratory discussions relating to COVID-19 research, with a variety of partners.”

According to the Financial Times, the challenge trials would be held at a facility used for quarantine in East London. Further details about how many people are expected to volunteer or how many vaccines will be tested still appear uncertain, though pharmaceutical companies such as Sanofi and AstraZeneca have said that they will not be involved.

Challenge trials aren’t a new thing in medicine. Ideally, they help fast- track research into infectious diseases like covid-19. Rather than wait potentially months or more for people given an experimental vaccine to become naturally exposed to the target germ, for instance, you can just study how they respond right from the get-go. Not only could this speed up human trials , but it could provide crucial insight into the natural history of a disease, both in how it sickens someone and in how the body fights back, since doctors would be there to monitor the person from the very beginning of their infection.

But though challenge trials have been used in the past to test some of the first vaccines and drugs ever developed, the design of tho se trials would be considered unethical and dangerous by today’s standards. In modern times, they have been used to study diseases like the flu, tuberculosis, and dengue, including to test out potential vaccines.

The problem is that it can be hard to develop challenge trials that don’t place people at too much risk. Challenge trials tend to work with well-known diseases that are treatable with existing medications or have strains milder than the more common variety in the wild. But neither option is really feasible for covid-19, which is approaching 1 million recorded fatalities worldwide (steroid drugs may help save the most severe cases, but their benefits are modest).

In lieu of this, advocates for a covid-19 challenge trial—most prominently led by the organization 1DaySooner—have proposed only using young, healthy adult volunteers, arguing that they face the least amount of risk from the viral illness. While it’s true that younger people are much less likely to die from covid-19 , critics have not ed that we don’t really have a firm grasp on the potential long- term complications of even a seemingly mild covid-19 case.

Another consideration is that challenge vaccine trials are usually used for diseases that are tricky to track in real time or may not be common in a natural setting. In countries like the U.S., however, covid-19 is still very prevalent, so it probably won’t be hard for people to become exposed to it. In the UK, daily new reported cases were very low during the summer, but the pandemic looks to be making a comeback both there and throughout Europe in recent weeks. By January, though, who knows what things will look like.

In any case, all vaccine trials—challenge or not—will be vetted for approval by the UK’s regulatory authorities. I t’s likely that challenge trials will be especially scrutinized for safety concerns, both locally and by others such as the World Health Organization. For what it’s worth, there seem to be no shortage of potential volunteers. According to the Financial Times, at least 2,000 people in the UK have pledged to volunteer for a challenge trial through 1DaySooner.","['country', 'challenge', 'vaccines', 'coronavirus', 'covid19', 'volunteers', 'test', 'uk', 'trials', 'vaccine', 'intentionally', 'used', 'potential', 'times']"

“He’s a scam artist,” comic book creator Samal McNealy said. “The way everything is written is just to benefit Andrew Rev and Terrific Production, and screw over writers and artists financially the best way he can.”

Terrific Production LLC, founded by owner Andrew Rev, popped onto the scene at San Diego Comic-Con 2019 and touts itself as “America’s fastest growing comics publisher,” although it’s yet to publish an issue. It’s only been around a year but has already faced issues—like being dissolved for two weeks in April 2020 by South Dakota’s Secretary of State (where Terrific Production is registered) over failing to submit its annual report on time. The company’s website is nonexistent, with no record of the domain ever having hosted a site. The publisher’s main presence is a Twitter account that has shared hundreds of gif-filled messages about how it’s “the next revolution in comics.”

The publisher, which for months slid along relatively unnoticed, got some attention recently after a series of clauses purportedly from its contracts started making the rounds on social media. They included: prohibiting creators from accepting new work if payments from Terrific Production weren’t overly late, requiring artists to turn over original art or signed pages in exchange for a share of a comic book’s net royalties, and a now-infamous covid-19 clause that meant the publisher could hold half a creator’s total page rate during the ongoing pandemic. io9 has viewed several of the contracts in question and can verify the clauses.

io9 spoke with 12 writers and artists who’ve either worked this past year with Terrific Production or entered talks to do so. Many of those who worked for the publisher confirmed they’ve yet to be fully compensated, leading to thousands of dollars in missing wages. They place the blame squarely on Rev, who some claim used deceitful tactics to try to swap their initial contracts with new ones that would impact their pay and rob them of their rights as creators.

“I think his company, and all that Terrific represents—he’s a hustler,” artist Daniel Mainé told io9. “I’d rather quit drawing before working with them again. It has been a real nightmare.”

Rev burst onto the comics scene in 1990 when he bought Comico, an independent publisher that was poised to rival DC and Marvel with series like Bill Willingham’s The Elementals and Matt Wagner’s Grendel. Unfortunately, a string of bad financial decisions led Comico to file for bankruptcy, leading Rev to come in from the outside and take it over. Rev refused to say how much he paid for Comico, but in a series of long (and often hard-to-understand) emails, he shared how he came into the industry eager but inexperienced only to wind up being taken advantage of.

[Note: Many of Rev’s responses, conducted over email, contained spelling and grammatical errors. We’ve chosen to present them as-is.]

“I was I’ll equipped to take on the revival of Comico- I had no staff. Imagine how I felt having paid their salary and then they treated me as a sucker!” Rev wrote. “With only love of comics and an A in art appreciation in college I went ahead to figure out without youtube or Wikipedia how comics were made. My original goal before I arrived was for us to be passive investors with 1/3 rd of Comico. But the president after he saw he had no obligation personally for his staff salary went and handed me the keys and said he was ‘going fishing’ this is how my book on the comic industry will Possibly start.” io9 was unable to contact the former owners of Comico for comment.

Reports on the sale from the Comics Journal described Rev as a Chicago businessman and native of Hungary who worked in the direct mail business and had done consulting for Citibank. A 2017 court case involving his ex-wife’s property showed he also tried to start a software business in Vietnam around a decade prior but that he made no money from it. Otherwise, Rev is an enigma. He’s believed to be 68 years old and living in California, has a small digital footprint, and his life between Comico and Terrific Production is largely unknown. Rev refused to provide or confirm with io9 any details on himself and noted that he expects “nothing personal in this article.”

After talking with the writers and artists, io9 reached out to Rev for an interview. His initial response was to send us a lengthy email suggesting what our article should cover, writing, “I hope you and your editor can see we have a very positive story covid story about overcoming adversity that Gizmodo readers could potentially identify with.” Rev echoed this suggestion in his final emails to us before publishing, writing, “you could always change the story into a story of the company that wants to save the comic industry.” On the morning this piece was set to publish he wrote, “I would appreciate you scrap your article or modify it.”

Rev repeatedly asked to speak off the record—meaning nothing he said to us could be used in our article—we declined, asking him several more times if he’d comment on the specific allegations made against him (which he ultimately did). Rev claimed on Twitter he wanted to speak off the record to “tell our story on the record without revealing sources and methods.” On Twitter, he called the article a “hit piece,” despite it not having been published yet; in emails, he went on to mention the 2016 Hulk Hogan lawsuit against our former sister site Gawker, which bankrupted Gawker Media, and took to Twitter several more times to discuss details about io9's editorial unit, GMG Union.

“I’d rather quit drawing before working with them again.”

Some of the creators we spoke with submitted pitches after seeing Terrific Production was promoting itself and soliciting creators on Facebook or Twitter. Others say they were recruited by writer Robert Shepard, who largely declined to comment (io9 has viewed text messages and emails showing Shepard setting up work and contracts with some of the creators). They saw that Rev holds the rights to Rob Liefeld’s Youngblood, originally published by Image Comics then Awesome Entertainment (Liefeld declined to comment for this story, but has been vocal on social media disavowing Rev and future iterations of Youngblood). Rev refused to share how he came about the rights to the series, which were arranged through Cowboys & Aliens co-creator Scott Rosenberg, calling it an “Inappropriate question under CONFIDENTIALITY.”

Youngblood was a series many of the creators we spoke to had grown up with, so they were interested in the prospect of helping a legacy property they loved come back to life. In addition, many of them were either new to the comics scene or trying to break into the American market—they saw it as an opportunity to grow their brand, especially since many of them were being asked to do multi-issue series. Gabriel Santos, a newer artist commissioned by Terrific to work on Supreme (a standalone series for a Youngblood character), said he thought it was going to be his big break.

“I was super excited for a nobody to get a chance to work on Youngblood characters, popular characters in the ‘90s. It was a great chance to get started,” Santos said. “Really, what got me excited was a lot of promises these guys had. ‘If all goes well I can get you some more covers for these books,’ or ‘If this book does really well I can up your page rate for the second book.’ Little promises like that.”

Looking back, the writers and artists we spoke to said they should’ve seen the warning signs. At least three creators, including artist Fritz Casas, said Shepard agreed to their starting rates with little attempt to negotiate. Penciler and inker Emiliano Urdinola, along with at least three others, said the initial contract was sent without Rev’s signature—only Mainé said he managed to get his signed. The contracts reviewed by io9 stipulated that Terrific Production would own artists’ original art (the comic industry’s version of an original painting). It’s a practice that’s considered uncommon and uncouth nowadays, as artists often sell their original pages on their own websites or through services. It also doesn’t apply to digital artists since they don’t make physical pieces—something Mainé said Shepard told him wouldn’t be a problem. It later turned out to be a problem.

The creators also said Terrific Production was set to pay them after completion of each issue, which took the creators we spoke to 1-3 months on average. Rev defended the practice, telling io9, “Some new artists like all people can’t be trusted without having a security deposit to remind them to do 5 issues. That’s smart.” But it’s something lawyer Gamal Hennessy, who specializes in work within the comic book industry, said should’ve been a red flag. Instead, Hennessy said, writers and artists should always ensure there’s a tiered payment system in place before getting to work.

“One payment could be made on signing the contract. One payment could be made on delivering the thumbnails, or the rough sketches. One payment could be made for the 22-page book, then let’s say every four pages another payment comes through,” he said. “That way, if there’s any dispute about what’s going on...then you actually understand what the problem is up front. So these artists are not out weeks and maybe months of work and not getting paid.”

About half the creators we spoke to got suspicious of Rev and walked away, either during negotiations or before completing their first issues. They were the lucky ones because the moment the first issues were turned in and a writer or artist asked for payment, chances are Rev would ask to speak with them over the phone or text and give reasons why they couldn’t be paid, like banking issues or problems with their work (Rev admitted that Terrific Production has refused to pay some creators for their work, claiming it’s for “if an artist over bills, did not have approval to increase rate.. Refused to redraw bad art”). Santos told io9 one of the excuses Rev gave him was because the inking wasn’t done, even though Santos had been hired as a penciler. Rev still texted Santos to ask how issue two was coming along. In the end, Santos said he was only paid for a cover before quitting.

For three of the creators we spoke to—Mainé, Urdinola, and Casas—the dispute was because of the contract. Rev would claim that the first contracts they’d signed were invalid for things like general mistakes, Shepard sending it without his approval, Rev never signing it, or it not coming from a Terrific Production email address. Mainé, whose contract had Rev’s signature, said Rev accused him of “forgery.” Rev repeated this accusation to io9 (though he didn’t mention Mainé by name), and Shepard backed it up in his only response to our questions. Shepard, identifying the person as Mainé, claimed Mainé “tried to pull a con on us. A wrong page rate and Euros vs USD,” but emails obtained by io9 show Shepard agreeing to Mainé’s rate and preferred currency, and sending him the contract with Rev’s signature. We asked Shepard to provide documentation to support his account, but he didn’t reply. Rev suggested we “get an expert to compare signatures,” so we asked him to provide examples. He didn’t reply to our request.

According to Mainé, Urdinola, and Casas, Rev insisted on sending them a new contract and wouldn’t pay them until they’d signed it (Rev chose not to “confirm or deny” most of the contract details, citing confidentiality). No matter how questionable the first deal was, this new deal was a whole lot worse.

There was the “Special Covid-19 Terms” clause, which Casas and one other artist confirmed was included in their proposed contracts. The clause stipulated that Terrific Production would hold onto half of their page rates until either 90% of people in the United States and Canada were vaccinated against the coronavirus, or 2,500 comic book shops in those countries were fully open again. (According to Publishers Weekly and the Joe Shuster Awards, there are about 2,000 comic book shops in the U.S. and approximately 300 in Canada.) This is something Hennessy called one of the most egregious parts of these already questionable deals.

“What they are doing is they are attempting to tie payments to circumstances beyond the control of anyone that is a party to this agreement—and anyone in the comic book industry in general,” Hennessy said. “You don’t have to be a lawyer to understand this: This is the kind of clause that you delete the contract and you go work for somebody else. Because what’s the justification for someone saying, ‘I’m not going to pay you the page rate for the work you did, based on a piece of public health information that has nothing to do with what we’re talking about’?”

“This is just stupid. This is an attempt to not pay someone based on something that has nothing to do with the contract,” he added.

That’s not all. Mainé and Urdinola said their new contracts slashed their page rates and shared royalties (after 10,000 copies sold), with Mainé saying his was cut by almost 50%. Rev confirmed the page rates Mainé and Urdinola shared with us, telling io9 each of them had “earned” the lower one he was offering. A portion of the new page rate, as well as royalties, were contingent upon the creator representing the comic and company “in a positive and supportive way.” Non-disparagement clauses are common in the industry, but Hennessy noted it was unusual that the contract stated Terrific Production could demand the writer or artist refund a portion of their payment if they failed to adequately show their support—and since it was unclearly defined, this meant it could be whatever Rev decided was insufficient. Some of the contracts also included a clause that required writers and artists to do convention appearances on behalf of Terrific Production, with no word as to whether the company would pay for travel expenses.

In addition to the covid-19 clause, Casas’ new contract included stipulations that put it a few steps short of an exclusive contract. Casas confirmed it banned him from accepting new work from other publishers so long as payments from Terrific Production weren’t over 45 days late, and he would have a three-year ban on working for any companies creating similar characters to ones he’d made for Terrific Production. While that might not apply to Casas, since he was making Supreme, Terrific Production has been working on a public domain version of Thor and is currently soliciting new artists for it. It’s unclear what the comic entails, but inker Matthew Seaborne said his involved a love triangle between Thor, Hercules, and Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz.

“This is just stupid. This is an attempt to not pay someone based on something that has nothing to do with the contract.”

Exclusive contracts aren’t an unusual concept on their face, as Marvel, DC, and other reputable publishers sign creators to exclusive contracts, but Hennessy said they typically come with lucrative financial benefits that make it worth the person’s while. In Casas’ case, he said it actually lowered his overall expected earnings—and if he quit anytime before finishing the series, the contract required him to refund “the deliverable payments paid in anticipation of [Casas] completing the series.” According to Casas, who’s from the Philippines, Rev told him he should feel grateful for the opportunity (in response to this, Rev said “any artist working for TP is lucky” and called Casas “not a gentle man”).



“Andrew Rev told me that, with the covid-19 pandemic, I’m lucky that I am working with them—and [with] the DC layoffs a lot of artists will be looking for work, pros will accept a lower page rate and I will be competing with them,” Casas said. “While it is true that overseas creators, especially in a third-world country like ours, are cheaper than our American counterparts, it is not a reasonable and acceptable excuse to exploit creators.”

Several writers and artists we spoke to said Rev told them he preferred international creators because they can be paid less than ones based in the United States, though Rev told io9 it’s “because major vip artists interfered win so went outside ofb USA.” Mainé, who’s based in Spain, shared that after Rev’s attempted contract swap fell through, Rev tried to pressure him over email to accept an even lower rate, $50 per page, and that half of that payment would be held hostage until Mainé turned over original artwork so Rev could sell it at auction—something, as previously mentioned, Mainé didn’t have and was told he wouldn’t need to provide since he works digitally. In his email, one of Rev’s defenses of this page rate, less than one-third of Mainé’s initial one, was because Mainé’s from a country where it’s still “very good compensation.”

Not everybody has shared this experience. Writer Leon McKenzie has been working with Terrific Production since 2019. He said he’s only signed one contract with the publisher (along with a separate NDA) and he’s been paid for every comic book he’s completed so far. That said, he declined to share his page rate, and when asked if he feels he’s being fairly compensated for his work, he veered into how it’s a step forward for his career before eventually saying yes. McKenzie said his time with Terrific Production has been positive—although he expressed irritation that none of the comic books he or anyone else has worked on have been published yet.



“I’m frustrated that it’s taken this long to get this far. I want a book on the shelf. And this makes me sound really selfish—because, once I’ve done that, then Little McKenzie has written an issue of Youngblood and that’s there forever,” he said.

Seaborne said he and Rev also shared a positive working relationship at the beginning—he said he was even paid for his comics work, albeit only half of what he was owed. According to Seaborne, Rev considered them to be friends and would call him regularly, keeping him on the phone for hours at a time (extended phone conversations are a common trait with Rev, according to every person we talked to). At one point, he said, Rev got the idea to start a record label called Terrific Records, part of his ambition to expand Terrific Production with children’s books, video games, clothing lines, and a cinematic universe. He asked Seaborne’s band to write a song that would be included in every copy of Youngblood—only instead of paying them, Rev sent the band a multi-year record deal. Seaborne called the contract “terrible” and refused to sign it. In response, he said Rev became rude and hostile to the point where Seaborne blocked his number.

“I’ve been offered some really, really terrible music contracts over the past 10 years, but this is hands-down the worst,” he said. “He tried to put everything in there to take every right away from us that we could possibly have. He wanted to change the band name. We had to write 40 songs a year. He would own pretty much everything to do with our likeness, the band itself. It was just the most crazy contract I’ve ever received.”

Rev told a different version of events, claiming he rewrote part of Seaborne’s song “with a witness” (whom he never named) and was simply trying to give the band an opportunity: “I asked Seaborne whose band making under $300 a song to write a song We are Legion, I told the of band to emulate. After first song I said I did not like all the lyrics it was violent = so I asked permission and I wrote changes with a witness. I said let me rep and I gave him a great deal better than unknown indie band gets plus cash. He turned to a ghost. Ask why? Maybe he had hit.”

“We reject the reason for industry norms in a failing industry. Innovate or die.”

Before Terrific Production and Youngblood, Rev’s crowning achievement in comics was Comico. At the time, writers and artists like Wagner spoke out to the Comics Journal about Rev’s unusual contracts and lack of payment for services rendered, but Willingham said that didn’t stop him from selling The Elementals. He told io9 that the deal with Rev came with stipulations like appearing at conventions to “talk up the handover.” Comico paid for his travel, along with several other writers and artists, only to find out Rev was putting them “in the outside room of his suite, in a barracks with nine or 10 beds shoved into a single area” (Rev confirmed that he took Comico staffers to cons but couldn’t recall any details).

Willingham also claimed Rev tried to cancel his final paycheck so he drove from Seattle to Chicago, where Comico was located, to demand it in person. He said he was either going to leave with the money he was promised or break enough of Rev’s stuff that it would make up the difference, but he ultimately got paid. Rev denied that Willingham’s final paycheck was ever canceled, but that he doesn’t remember whether the writer came to see him at his office in Chicago. “Willingham final payment was never cancelled for rights or writing! To bring up such nonsense 30 years later is meaningless if Willingham was paid,” he said.

Comico quietly stopped producing comics in 1997—following years of inconsistent releases and series that never went past a few issues—ending on an issue of The Elementals Sex Specials Vol. 2. The first issue of the short-lived X-rated series lists Willingham as its writer, but he told io9 he’d actually turned in an issue of The Elementals (as part of his contractual obligations) only for Rev to rename it without his knowledge or consent and slap on a salacious cover of a woman having sex with a dolphin. Rev confirmed that Willingham’s final issue was turned into an 18+ sex special, and told us “it’s was my opinion that it was wrong to force under 18 years olds to not have an issue because I was a prude and thought in 1990’s that any sexWas too much for kids. they were under age which is why it was made into its own title.” But when asked to explain why the publisher put bestiality on the cover, he didn’t answer.

The publisher, now going by “Comico Entertainment LLC,” still exists and is registered in South Dakota—although it’s under the name of his brother, Steven Rev, and Andrew Rev said he doesn’t own shares of the company. It debuted at San Diego Comic-Con in 2019 but has yet to publish anything since.

Terrific Production has grown in notoriety in recent weeks as more folks in the industry have been sharing the most bewildering parts of Rev’s contracts and creators who feel they’ve been burned are warning others to stay away. Despite the backlash, Terrific Production is still trying to recruit writers and artists—going so far as to ask people on Twitter to submit full-issue comics with its characters “at their own risk!” and that if the company likes them they might buy them. Rev told io9 they “no longer want freelancers,” and the publisher is now focused on signing people to exclusive contracts. He wouldn’t share any details —although on Twitter the publisher mentioned providing “stipends & Royalties”—but some of the people we spoke to worry the contracts are no better than before. Rev said five creators (whom he hasn’t identified) have signed exclusive contracts so far and that Terrific Production is expected to announce its first titles on November 10.

“We reject the reason for industry norms in a failing industry. Innovate or die. Ownership depends if the artists choses an Image comic type artists deal where they take the risk on paying for our imprint and printing and marketing – they then can own the art than we have a rep fee. Or chose a TP acquired character than we share income because we are an IP development platform for the global market,” Rev said. “We recognize artists fought for rights which we say chose that. I believe others will follow because comics are dying.”

Terrific Production might swear it’s innovating, that it’s “the next revolution in comics,” but it’s running on an outdated playbook. One that has tried to take advantage of comic book writers and artists even though it’s left the company and Rev himself without anything to show for it. Unlike his time at Comico—where the experiences of Willingham, Wagner, and others were lost to history—social media has made it so all of these comics creators can share their stories. It seems Andrew Rev’s old tricks don’t work in the new digital age.

“The man is a crook, I think he’s an idiot, and I think he’s insane. I think in this business of ours, you might be able to get away with any two of the three and still find your niche. But all three, you can’t be all three and make a go of it,” Willingham said. “This enterprise, the current one, is going to fail—just as every other attempt has.”

Humans aren’t the only creatures at risk from dying of covid-19, it seems. In recent weeks, the state of Utah has been dealing with mass die-offs at mink farms that health officials believe are linked to the viral pandemic—outbreaks that likely began from contact with infected human handlers. So far, nearly 10,000 minks in Utah are thought to have died during these outbreaks in the span of two weeks.

According to Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF), these deaths have been concentrated among nine fur farms in the state. Shortly before dying, UDAF veterinarian Dean Taylor told NBC News, these minks experience respiratory symptoms like trouble breathing or runny noses and eye discharge, similar to what happens in people sick with covid-19. As with people, older minks seem to be more susceptible to dying from the coronavirus, he added.

For months now, scientists have known that minks and other weasels, like ferrets, can become infected with the coronavirus that causes covid-19, and that they can catch it from infected humans. Unlike cats, dogs, and other animals that the virus has infected through human contact, however, weasels seem to be especially vulnerable to more serious illness. That’s made these animals a useful model for studying the virus outside of a petri dish in the lab, but it’s also made them an easy target for the virus in the real world.

Indeed, Utah’s outbreaks are not the first to have hit mink farms. Earlier outbreaks in the Netherlands and Spain prompted officials there to cull more than 1 million minks to prevent the infection from spreading further. So far, no minks in Utah have been killed as a precaution during these recent outbreaks, though affected farms have enacted quarantines. The UDAF is also working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies to secure more personal protective equipment and training for farmers working with minks in the state.

As dire as these outbreaks have been for the mink industry, the danger to people seems to be low. Though people can spread the virus to minks and other animals, the risk of these animals then spreading the infection back to other susceptible people is thought to be very low, according to the CDC.

As US government scientists work to understand how Covid-19 affects the human body, tribal nations are still struggling with the impacts of the federal government’s inadequate response to the pandemic. Now, through a National Institutes of Health program called “All of Us,” tribal nations across Indian Country are pushing federal scientists to conduct disease research that serves indigenous peoples in a meaningful way. Developing research practices in accordance with tribal consultation takes time, however, meaning that for now, tribal citizens are missing out on the program’s coronavirus antibody testing.

The All of Us study aims to collect, sequence, and catalog DNA representative of the United States’ diverse communities. This vast project will enable research into diseases such as Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases across the country. But tribal nations are concerned about the ownership and control of this data, which can affect a number of things: patents and intellectual property rights, the privacy of tribes, future research, and even access to basic information and health care.

“We’re concerned about access to data as well as release of data without tribal permission,” said Stephanie Russo (Ahtna-Native village of Kluti-Kaah), a University of Arizona public health professor. “What the pandemic has shed a light on is the need for tribes to have access to external data.”

The coronavirus pandemic has given the indigenous data-sovereignty movement a new sense of urgency. As pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and governments scramble to create Covid-19 tests and vaccines, many tribal leaders and indigenous data and public health experts are wary of participating in research that may have little benefit for their communities.

The indigenous data-sovereignty movement emerged in 2015, when indigenous researchers convened in Australia to discuss research on native peoples and indigenous rights under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. They concluded that indigenous nations retain ownership over their citizens’ data, as well as the power to decide how that data is used. All this made news earlier this year, when the US was widely criticized for a major data breach that leaked the financial data of tribal nations that had submitted applications for Covid-19 relief.

What’s more, in the past, medical researchers have stigmatized and harmed indigenous communities. In some cases, they did not report their findings to the tribes who participated. A 1979 study on an Inupiat community in Alaska resulted in widespread publicity on the community’s alcohol use, encouraging harmful stereotypes. Researchers who took blood samples from the Havasupai Tribe in 1989 conducted a diabetes study and allowed other researchers to access the samples without the tribe’s knowledge or consent. The federal government’s past use of ancestry, such as blood quantum, to terminate tribal nations and limit tribal sovereignty, means there is little trust today for government-funded genetic research. This is why tribes insist on sharing ownership of the data collected by All of Us. It would allow them to have input regarding future research that makes use of indigenous data.

“Understand: Data is a resource,” said Keolu Fox (Kanaka ‘Ōiwi), assistant professor of anthropology at University of California, San Diego, who studies genome science and indigenous communities. Fox has argued that unrestricted access to genome data by state governments and pharmaceutical companies is a threat to tribal sovereignty and may have little direct benefit aside from individual test results—meaning tribes will likely not receive subsidized medications, intellectual property rights, or royalties in return for their data. During a May National Institutes of Health tribal consultation, NIH researchers recognized the minimal benefits of indigenous participation, as Fox noted, stating that the primary gain would be those individual test results.","['covid', 'access', 'researchers', 'strengthening', 'tribal', 'push', 'data', 'nations', 'indigenous', 'research', 'health', 'control', 'rights', 'tribes']"

Today, a startup that is also tapping the potential and opportunity in distributed computing is announcing a round of growth funding to continue its own work.

Anyscale, a startup founded by a team out of UC Berkeley that created the Ray open-source Python framework for running distributed computing projects, has raised $40 million.

It plans to use the capital to continue developing Anyscale, a platform built on Ray that will make Ray usable not just by high-level developers and computing specialists, but any technical people who are looking to run projects that require large amounts of computing power.

Ion Stoica, Anyscale’s executive chairman who co-founded the company with Robert Nishihara, Philipp Moritz and Berkeley professor Michael I. Jordan, said in an interview that the company is tapping into a moment spurred not just by the events of 2020 but by the bigger demand from companies — spurred by the growth of cloud computing, major digital transformation of their systems and a need to go that extra mile to remain competitive. Organizations are becoming more ambitious in their technology strategies and goals, whether they are tech companies or not.

“At a high level, the trend that we see is that all applications are distributed and running on clusters, but building these applications is incredibly hard and requires teams with the right expertise,” said Stoica. “What we are trying to build will make it as easy to build a distributed computing project as it would be to run a program on your laptop. It will mean ordinary developers will be able to build scalable applications just like Google can build today.”

The company’s first build of Anyscale — which will let organizations build multi-cloud applications from a single machine and use serverless architecture that scales up and down to meet application demands — has yet to launch commercially: it is in a private beta and the plan is to launch it fully next year.

There has been interest from financial services, retail and manufacturing companies, Stoica said, with companies working in design, informatics and medical research (and COVID-19 vaccines) also using the private beta.

The Series B is being led by previous investor NEA, with Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Intel Capital and Foundation Capital also participating. A16z led the company’s Series A less than a year ago (a $20 million round in December).

Intel, meanwhile, is a strategic investor. Along with other tech giants like Microsoft, Intel is using Ray’s distributed computing model to run projects.

Stoica — who also co-founded Databricks, Conviva and was one of the original developers of Apache Spark — and Nishihara declined to comment in an interview on Anyscale’s valuation, but Stoica confirmed that the round was oversubscribed. The company has now raised just over $60 million.

While the startup continues to build out Anyscale, in the last year it has also been making more headway with Ray, which they also maintain.

At the Ray Summit — Anyscale’s conference for developers run as a virtual event at the end of September — Anyscale released Ray 1.0, which provides, in addition to a universal serverless compute API, an expanded library to use on Ray 1.0. Nishihara described it as a “huge milestone,” not least because it is one step along the path for the bigger vision they have for Anyscale to be used by non-tech companies for tech work.

A typical example was a recent recommendation algorithm built by Intel for Burger King. “The thing that is hard to do is not making the recommendations but learning from the interactions that users are having, and the choices they are making, and having that experience reflected back very rapidly,” he said. It’s a process that can be done in other ways, but with a far less good user experience due to lags.

This past year Nishihara said that interest in Ray has seen “tremendous growth,” but that it’s hard to say whether that is because of people working from home or just wider computing trends.

“It’s clear if anything that the pandemic is accelerating the transition,” said Stoica. “Ray has good support for the cloud, including Azure, Google Cloud Platform and others, which makes it quite compelling.”

We’ve seen an interesting trend in enterprise IT, where startups are finding an opportunity in the market by making it possible for non-technical organizations to bridge the digital divide, by providing better access to the most technical advances in computing to organizations beyond those that can build and operate such tools themselves. Just as groups like Element AI are working on ways to democratize advances in AI, the same kind of tech built, acquired and used by the likes of Apple, Google and Amazon, so too is Anyscale looking to do the same in enterprise computing.

And the two areas of AI and computing, of course, are interconnected: these days you need vast amounts of computing power to run AI applications, something the average company typically lacks.

“The demand for distributed computing continues to increase with the widespread adoption of AI and machine learning in application development,” said Pete Sonsini, general partner at NEA, in a statement. “Still, scaling applications on clusters remains extremely challenging. Serverless computing is emerging as the preferred platform for developing distributed applications. Unfortunately, today’s serverless offerings support only a limited set of applications, and most of them are cloud-specific—but not Ray and Anyscale. The company’s path thus far bears the hallmarks of a standout technology pioneer, and we’re thrilled to partner with the team through this next phase bridging their open source and commercial offerings.”","['anyscale', 'ai', 'companies', 'computing', 'distributed', 'raybased', 'bring', 'applications', 'enterprise', 'adds', 'techcrunch', 'ray', 'build', 'stoica', 'tech', 'run', 'masses']"

At a minimum, the president will spend early October in quarantine rather than on the campaign trail. Apart from what this means for his health, you’re probably wondering what it means for November 3. The simple answer is, no one really knows. But here’s what to keep your eye on.

First, the uncertainty regarding the virus exposure itself. It will be at least a week before testing and contact tracing can fully tell us who else has contracted the virus. Did Trump and his unmasked supporters spread it to members of the Biden campaign, or to campaign trail reporters during Tuesday’s indoor shoutfest of a debate? Biden has so far tested negative, but that could change.

Who else on the Trump campaign will have to quarantine? Will Trump himself be quarantined for a couple of weeks while mildly symptomatic, firing off the same tweetstorms that have typified his entire presidency? (He’s been pretty quiet since the diagnosis.) Or will he require intensive, ongoing medical support, reshaping the campaign with uncertainty about his physical well-being?

If Trump falls seriously ill, then everything about this election changes: Early voting has already begun in many states. There is simply no precedent for a presidential candidate being replaced on the ballot at such a late stage. And in a digital information environment that is rampant with viral rumors and partisan misinformation on a good day, we have to worry that chaos would fill the resulting vacuum. But even if his symptoms remain mild, the campaign effects are likely to be substantial. That’s because Trump’s diagnosis effectively guarantees that the next few weeks of the election will be focused on the coronavirus.

Trump’s goal over the next five weeks is not to win the argument about the severity of the coronavirus. It’s to change the subject.

There’s been some speculation that Friday morning’s news could actually end up helping the president’s campaign, boosting his support through pity or concern—a sort of rally-’round-the-flagging effect. That’s absurd: Trump has spent months trying to make the election about something, anything, other than the virus. This was clear during the Republican National Convention, where he and his surrogates declared victory over the pandemic and promised a vaccine would materialize before Election Day. It was clear during the debate, where Trump replied to Biden’s critique of his administration’s pandemic response by changing the subject entirely. The campaign’s best shot at victory lies in doubling down on mass rallies, ginning up a game-changing moment in the upcoming debates, and doing everything possible to focus public attention on “leftist rioters” or the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. If voters are left to ask themselves whether they’re better off than they were four years ago, the answer is almost certain to be no.

Let’s say Trump quickly recovers, though. In that case, he will probably offer it as proof that the virus is not so bad after all. His supporters would claim vindication. But that would not help him on Election Day. Trump’s goal over the next five weeks is not to win the argument about the severity of the coronavirus. His goal is to change the subject and have a different argument altogether.

The closest analogy for any of this from previous elections might be James Comey’s October 28 letter to Congress about Hillary Clinton’s emails in 2016. Few things really matter in the long arc of an electoral campaign, but Nate Silver has pretty conclusively shown that the Comey letter had an impact. Coming as it did, within two weeks of the election, it put questions about Clinton’s trustworthiness front-and-center in voters’ minds at the most crucial moment. The very last phase of the campaign was centered on her emails, and voters who disliked both candidates ultimately broke decisively for Trump. Had a different topic dominated the final weeks of the election, the outcome very well might have been different. Trump’s diagnosis could have a similar effect in the final weeks of this election.

Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.

Online misinformation, meanwhile, is likely to move into overdrive. This would have happened anyway, with foreign and domestic operatives spreading whatever lies and fabrications seem to be gaining the most traction via Facebook’s algorithms. But now we’ll have a better idea of which lies will be pushed: conspiracy theories surrounding Trump’s health, and how he got infected, as well as unhinged speculation as to the origins of the virus. Expect QAnon supporters to become medical experts. Expect rumors that Democrats and Chinese operatives secretly gave Trump the virus. Expect claims that the vaccine has arrived, but it’s being suppressed. Expect falsified news accounts about Covid outbreaks at polling places.

The final thing to keep in mind, though, is that there are still a lot of news cycles between now and Election Day. If Trump fully recovers in two weeks, that still leaves him with a couple more in which to try to change the subject. The White House’s efforts to shut down mail-in ballots, undermine the postal service, intimidate voters at polling locations, and challenge voting procedures through the courts will continue regardless of the candidate’s health.

That’s the one prediction we should be confident in right now: This has been the most chaotic election in American history. There’s still time left. Somehow, it will get weirder.

People are looking to find out who is close to them. Who is in their community. People are understandably looking for new friends and resources close to them.

Apps that connect young mums locally (Pumpspotting, Peanut), professionals (Fishbowl, Lunchclub), Jetset daters (Raya, Bumble), digital nomads (Homeis), locals (Nextdoor ) and millennials (Friended) are all being dialed-up.

And with government lockdowns coming back for their “2nd album,” the U.K.’s millennials and Gen Zs are increasingly turning to location-based apps to try to hang out with each other and burst the so-called “rule of six” bubble, whether the government wants them to or not.

Pickle is fast making a name for itself amongst an estimated 350,000 millennials and Gen Zs for that reason. After starting out as a TaskRabbit-style app for Gen Z, it is now seeing growth as an app for that generation to find fellow travelers locally, even as their normal travel has been curtailed by COVID-19.

Founder Daneh Westropp says: “Loneliness is the number one fear of young people today — ranking ahead of losing a home or a job; 71% of millennials reported feeling lonely [survey conducted by Cigna] and 69% of millennials experience FOMO when they can’t attend something that their family or friends are going to [study by Eventbrite]. So it comes as no surprise that people genuinely hate doing certain activities alone.” That’s why, she says, Pickle is climbing up app-store rankings.

Westropp understands the feeling of alienation. She ran away from Tehran during the 1988 Iran/Iraq war with her mother and sister, and was raised by a single mother who suffered from loneliness and depression. After dropping out of school at the age of 15, she went on to join the ranks of other entrepreneurs.

But a few problems remain with the Pickle app that are cause for concern. It has no 2FA for starters. Plus, the lack of regulation or content filtering means it’s anyone’s guess who users might be arranging to meet. Those are big red flags for the average observer.

Whether Gen Z cares or not during a global pandemic that has shut down their lives remains to be seen.","['location', 'covid', 'app', 'lockdowns', 'pickle', 'latch', 'z', 'gen', 'apps', 'techcrunch', 'fight', 'zs', 'young', 'mother', 'millennials', 'loneliness', 'looking']"

YouTube announced on Wednesday that it will now be extending current rules about lies, propaganda, and conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic to include misinformation about coronavirus vaccines.

Per Reuters, the video giant now says it will prohibit content about coronavirus vaccines that “[contradicts] expert consensus from local health authorities or the [World Health Organization]”—such as bogus claims the vaccine is a pretext to stick people with tracking chips or that it will kill recipients and/ or secretly sterilize them. The company also told Reuters that it would limit the spread of content that borders on violating the rules, though it didn’t elaborate on how it would do that.

Google’s rules already covered topics relating to treatment, prevention, diagnostics, and transmission of the virus, though the previous rules only specifically mentioned vaccines in the context of false claims that one “is available or that there’s a guaranteed cure.”

“A COVID-19 vaccine may be imminent, therefore we’re ensuring we have the right policies in place to be able to remove misinformation related to a COVID-19 vaccine,” YouTube spokesperson Farshad Shadloo told The Verge.

YouTube has historically struggled to prevent misinformation about the pandemic, which racked up countless millions of views on the site throughout 2020.

A study released in September by the Oxford Research Institute and Reuters Institute, partially covering the period of October 2019 and June 2020, found that coronavirus misinformation videos on YouTube had been shared more than 20 million times on Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. That outranked CNN, ABC News, BBC, Fox News, and Al Jazeera’s combined reach on those sites over the same period (15 million). The researchers were only able to identify 8,105 videos removed by YouTube containing “covid-related misinformation” in that time period, which was less than 1% of all coronavirus videos.

Interestingly, the researchers also found strong evidence the primary driver of viral coronavirus videos on YouTube was Facebook, not subscribers to the YouTube channels themselves. This also potentially helps that content circumvent YouTube’s community standards enforcement, which is highly reliant on user reports; Facebook has implemented some loophole-laden rules on anti-vax content in ads but does not have rules against organic or unpaid anti-vax posts. From the study:

Misinformation videos shared on Facebook generated a total of around 11,000 reactions (likes, comments or shares), before being deleted by YouTube... The Oxford researchers also found that out of the 8,105 misinformation videos shared on Facebook between October 2019 and June 2020, only 55 videos had warning labels attached to them by third party fact checkers, less than 1% of all misinformation videos. This failure of fact-checking helped Covid-related misinformation videos spread on Facebook and find a large audience. Oxford researchers observed that despite YouTube’s investment in containing the spread of misinformation, it still took YouTube on average 41 days to remove Covid-related videos with false information. Misinformation videos were viewed on average 150,000 times, before they were deleted by YouTube.

YouTube has also been a hub for anti-vax content more generally. While research last year (before the pandemic) found it was on the decline, the anti-vax movement is far from forced off the site. A University of Pennsylvania Annenberg Public Policy Center study in February unsurprisingly found that those who relied on traditional media outlets to learn about vaccines were less likely to believe in anti-vax claims than those who did on social media. A recent Pew Survey found that some 26% of U.S. adults get news on YouTube and that the content they are consuming is more likely to be laden with conspiracy info.

Producers and consumers of misinformation are adept at evading crackdowns. According to Wired, YouTube’s internal teams tasked with hunting down and eliminating videos with false claims about the virus found that its recommendation system—which had been successfully tweaked to promote significantly less conspiracy content in 2019—was becoming increasingly less important to driving large amounts of traffic to false claims about the coronavirus. Instead, they had noticed a major uptick in the number of videos which were uploaded and quickly promoted off-site via a “mix of organic link-sharing and astroturfed, bot-propelled promotion” on other sites like Facebook and Reddit.

YouTube told the Telegraph in September that the Oxford and Reuters study used data that was out of date. A spokesperson told the Guardian on Wednesday the company has removed more than 200,000 videos since early February, though many of them could have been re-uploads, automatically generated, or otherwise posted in corners where they had little chance of going viral in the first place.

Another recent study by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard found that social media was secondary to the spread of conspiracy theories about voting by mail, with the main driver being fake claims by Donald Trump and Republican allies that were then amplified by coverage in the traditional media. This appears to match findings by Oxford and Reuters researchers in April, who found prominent public figures made just 20% of claims in a sample of 225 statements rated false by fact checkers, but generated 69% of social media engagement.

Platforms including YouTube have had some success limiting the spread of some misinformation efforts, such as a sequel to the infamous Plandemic video that racked up more than 8 million views in May (the sequel’s release, however, was announced in advance). In September, YouTube moved to delete clips from a Hoover Institution interview with White House coronavirus adviser Dr. Scott Atlas, who has sowed doubt about the effectiveness of social distancing and wink-wink, nudge-nudged the Trump administration toward a dangerous “herd immunity” strategy.

According to the Guardian, YouTube says it will announce more steps it is taking to limit the spread of misinformation about vaccines on its site in the coming weeks.","['media', 'vaccines', 'coronavirus', 'rules', 'content', 'remove', 'videos', 'facebook', 'youtube', 'misinformation', 'lying', 'claims', 'spread']"

A 28-year-old Brazilian resident participating in a covid-19 vaccine trial run by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford has died of complications related to the coronavirus, a local media outlet reported Wednesday. Health officials and those leading the study have not confirmed whether the volunteer had received the experimental vaccine or a placebo prior to his death. According to a spokesperson for UK-based drugmaker AstraZeneca, the trial will continue as planned.

The death was reported by news outlet O Globo. According to their report, the volunteer died last Thursday. Brazil’s public health and regulatory agency, the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), was informed of the death Monday and is evaluating the case with the cooperation of the vaccine’s developers, O Globo reported.

The person had been participating in a large international clinical trial of the jointly developed vaccine, which uses a weakened version of an adenovirus as its delivery method. Early last month, trials in the UK and elsewhere were temporarily paused after a woman in the vaccine group had developed neurological symptoms. However, the independent committee overseeing these trials concluded that the woman’s case was either unlikely to be connected to the vaccine or that there wasn’t enough evidence to confirm one way or the other. Soon after, the trials were restarted most everywhere, though not in the U.S. as of yet.

While neither ANVISA nor the medical centers involved in the Brazilian volunteer’s care would confirm the person’s status in the trial, O Globo cited anonymous sources who reportedly said the volunteer was in the placebo group, meaning they did not receive an experimental vaccine. Bloomberg News, citing an anonymous source, also reports that the participant received a placebo.

In a statement emailed to Gizmodo, an AstraZeneca spokesperson said, “We cannot comment on individual cases in an ongoing trial of the Oxford vaccine as we adhere strictly to medical confidentiality and clinical trial regulations, but we can confirm that all required review processes have been followed. All significant medical events are carefully assessed by trial investigators, an independent safety monitoring committee and the regulatory authorities. These assessments have not led to any concerns about continuation of the ongoing study.”



The University of Oxford has not responded to a request for comment.

Brazil has been one of the hardest-hit areas of the world during this pandemic. As of Wednesday, more than 150,000 people there have died from the viral illness—a number second only to the U.S. official death toll of 221,000.","['placebo', 'brazil', 'covid19', 'reportedly', 'coronavirus', 'medical', 'globo', 'received', 'dies', 'trials', 'vaccine', 'health', 'death', 'died', 'oxford', 'volunteer', 'trial']"

""Tonight I tested positive for COVID-19. My symptoms are mild (light cough) and I'm feeling fine. I have begun a quarantine process in consultation with physicians,"" Conway tweeted. ""As always, my heart is with everyone affected by this global pandemic.""

Conway is now the fifth person who attended the event last week, where masks and social distancing were rare, known to have subsequently tested positive. President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Republican North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis and University of Notre Dame President the Rev. John Jenkins are all confirmed to be positive for Covid-19.

Many of the guests for Trump's announcement that he was nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett arrived at the event with masks on, but as the Rose Garden event got underway, masks were virtually nonexistent

Some of the Trump administration's top health officials, as well as other attendees, were seen not wearing masks or social distancing at the highest-profile event at the White House since the Republican National Convention in August.

Seats for guests in the White House Rose Garden also did not appear spaced apart the recommended six feet, CNN reporters observed.

Conway also had interacted with Trump and other advisers since Saturday, CNN has reported, participating in debate prep sessions with the President on Sunday and Monday , people familiar with the matter told CNN.

Kellyanne Conway's husband, George Conway, appeared to weigh in on the news with a jab at the President.

""I can relate,"" he tweeted Friday night of a news story about frustrated Secret Service agents asserting that the President's actions have put them at risk of catching coronavirus.

Her departure marked an abrupt end to her high-profile tenure at the White House, where she earned a reputation as one of the President's fiercest -- and most controversial -- defenders.

She landed her position in 2016 after becoming the first female campaign manager to win a presidential race, asserting during her remarks at the National Republican Convention this August that ""President Trump helped me shatter a barrier in the world of politics, by empowering me to manage his campaign to its successful conclusion.""

But she also faced controversies. Last year, the US Office of Special Counsel recommended that she be removed from federal service , saying she had violated the Hatch Act on numerous occasion and erred by ""disparaging Democratic presidential candidates while speaking in her official capacity during television interviews and on social media.""

Political tension with her husband had also spilled into public view in recent years. A Washington lawyer who was considered for multiple Justice Department posts early in Trump's tenure, George Conway quickly emerged as a prominent, outspoken critic of the President.

He's previously said Trump is ""guilty"" of being unfit for office , called for Congress to remove the ""cancer"" of Trump from the presidency and openly questioned the President's mental health.

But Kellyanne Conway has pushed back. Last year, after her husband's tweets cast doubt on Trump's mental state, she told reporters that ""no, I don't share those concerns.""

The President himself took a more lighthearted approach. Asked about a critique that George Conway issued last November, Trump made clear where his allegiance stood.

""You mean Mr. Kellyanne Conway?"" he asked.

A new phishing scam is duping unsuspecting victims with enticing links promising access to President Trump’s alleged health records and top-secret COVID-19 treatment information. In reality, these misleading links are triggering downloads that sneak a new, dangerous form of malware onto the PCs of unsuspecting truth-seekers .

The ProofPoint cybersecurity firm discovered the scam soon after news of Trump’s COVID-19 diagnosis broke. According to the firm’s report, clicking the fake link infects your PC with the “BazaLoader” trojan. BazaLoader is a “first-stage downloader” that allows hackers to view files on the victim’s PC and install other malware remotely. It can even grant access to other devices on the same local network, putting your family, roommates, or coworkers at risk even if they don’t download anything.

BazaLoader is a massive threat on its own, but this s cam uses the trojan to distribute a new, unknown type of malware. Researchers are looking into everything this new malware can do.

""I think we're right now at the cusp of what's going to be exponential spread in parts of the country,"" Gottlieb said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

""If we took aggressive steps right now, we could potentially forestall the worst of it, but we're not going to do that,"" because there's a lot of fatigue and ""policy resistance to taking strong action,"" he said.

""We really have two or three months of the acute phase of this pandemic to get through,"" he said. ""This is going to be the hardest phase, probably.""

Worst number of cases yet

That's as the country continues to report the most number of cases we've seen to date. The seven-day average of daily new cases reached an all-time high of 68,767 on Sunday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The previous record of 67,293 was set July 22.

""Unfortunately, I think the statement about 'new record' is going to be repeated over and over again in the days and weeks to come,"" said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.

""I expect that those numbers will continue to climb. Hospitalizations are going to continue to climb.""

The abysmal week was marked by the two worst days of daily new cases reported since the pandemic began. More than 83,000 new cases were reported both Friday and Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins.

To be clear: This surge reflects an onslaught of new infections -- not just increased testing, contrary to what skeptics claim.

""You know why we have cases? Because we test so much,"" President Donald Trump claimed at a rally Saturday in North Carolina. ""And in many ways, it's good. And in many ways, it's foolish.""

But the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has soared 23% in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins data. The seven-day average of new tests performed has risen only 2.87% over the past week, according to the Covid Tracking Project.

And we are long past the point of just urban, heavily populated areas being the only places hit hard. South Dakota's test positivity rate is 23%, the state's health department said Monday. That means of every 100 people tested, 23 have been infected. The World Health Organization in May advised governments not to reopen until test positivity rates were 5% or lower for at least 14 days.

States to receive 36.7 million rapid tests

The federal government is shipping 36.7 million rapid Covid-19 tests, and states should be receiving them by the end of the week, the US Department of Health and Human Services told CNN Monday.

The tests are intended to help states with reopening, according to an HHS news release.

""To protect seniors and to facilitate the continued re-opening of schools, businesses and the economy, the Trump Administration prioritized scaling-up our state and national point of care testing capacity,"" Adm. Dr. Brett Giroir, the department's assistant secretary for health, said in a news release Sunday.

President Donald Trump last month announced a plan to send 150 million BinaxNOW Covid-19 tests nationally. HHS on Monday confirmed that this week's shipments are part of that total.

""Combining personal responsibility with smart, targeted testing is a proven formula to prevent outbreaks -- but we cannot 'test our way' out of this pandemic,"" Giroir said. ""Public vigilance in adhering to precautionary measures is required -- especially as we clearly see the onset of mitigation fatigue.""

What happens when hospitals get overwhelmed

Some hospitals are starting to max out because of the new surge. And that's bad news for everyone -- not just those with coronavirus.

""We've seen what happened earlier in this pandemic, when hospitals become overwhelmed and patients end up not receiving care -- not only patients with coronavirus, but also patients with heart attacks and strokes and were in car accidents,"" emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen said.

In Utah, for example, hospitals could be days away from using a patient's age, health and other factors to decide who can stay in crowded intensive care units , and who can't.

""That potentially could be occurring all over the country as our hospitals become overwhelmed,"" Wen said. ""And unlike last time, where it was only certain parts of the country that were experiencing this, now we have virus hotspots that are occurring everywhere.""

As of Monday, at least 37 states had growing numbers of new Covid-19 cases this past week compared with the previous week, according to Johns Hopkins data. Thirteen states were holding roughly steady, and no state had Covid-19 decreases of at least 10%.

More than 8.6 million people have been infected with coronavirus in the US, and more than 225,000 have died.

We have 'a narrow window of opportunity right now'

Yes, the dreaded fall surge is spreading across the country. But if we act quickly, we can prevent it from turning into a catastrophic winter surge, doctors say.

""This is not inevitable. We actually have a narrow window of opportunity right now to stop the explosive spread that is coming,"" Wen said Monday.

""But we have this window to take action now. That includes things like national mask mandates, that includes other targeted policies. This is not an all-or-nothing,"" she said.

""President Trump tends to frame this as either we shut down completely, or we literally do nothing. Actually, there's a lot that we can do that will both save lives and also keep our economy going. We should implement those policies now.""

In Illinois, ""there seems to be a Covid storm on the rise, and we have to get prepared,"" Gov. J.B. Pritzker warned Monday, announcing some restrictions starting for some regions in the state starting Wednesday.

In Idaho, Gov. Brad Little announced Monday he is moving the state back to a more restrictive phase.

And in Kentucky, a health official expressed concern about a third escalation of the virus that is starting at a higher level of infections than the first two.

""We're running a lot hotter now. It's like the popcorn is popping in the microwave at full intensity, and if we launch from here, this is where we get in trouble real fast,"" Dr. Steven Stack, commissioner of the Kentucky Department for Public Health, said at a news conference Monday.

A national mask mandate could help keep businesses open

A growing number of officials from across party lines are calling for a nationwide mask mandate.

Gottlieb, a former FDA head appointed by Trump, wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal titled ""Winter Is Coming: Time for a Mask Mandate.""

""A mandate can be expressly limited to the next two months,"" Gottlieb wrote, adding that it's easier to wear a mask in the winter than the summer.

""The inconvenience would allow the country to preserve health-care capacity and keep more schools and businesses open.""

Andy Slavitt, former acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, agreed with Gottlieb on a mask mandate.

""Scott Gottlieb was a Republican. This is not a partisan issue,"" said Slavitt, who served in the Obama administration.

""This is an issue for everyone's public health, and will slow down the spread of the disease.""

If 95% of Americans wore masks in public, more than 100,000 lives could be saved in the United States through February, according to data released Friday by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.

""If people are not wearing masks, then maybe we should be mandating it,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Europe is now reporting more daily infections than the United States, Brazil, or India -- the countries that have been driving the global case count for months -- as public apathy grows towards coronavirus guidelines. Several countries are seeing infection rates spiral again after a summer lull that saw measures to contain the virus and travel restrictions relaxed.

In the United Kingdom, for example, questions are being asked about whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson's decision to lift the country's lockdown in June was premature. Northern England's current high rates of Covid-19 are down to the fact that infections ""never dropped as far in the summer as they did in the south,"" Jonathan Van-Tam, Britain's deputy chief medical officer, told a press conference on Monday.

It is just the latest problem to beset Britain's slapdash pandemic response. There are now more patients in hospital with Covid-19 in England than there were in March, when a nationwide lockdown was imposed, according to Johnson and health officials.

France and the Netherlands broke their own records over the weekend, reporting the highest numbers of confirmed Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic.

In the United States, there were more new positive cases in the White House on October 2 than in the whole of Taiwan, after President Donald Trump became the second G7 leader (after Johnson) to test positive for Covid-19. Despite his illness, Trump has continued to downplay the severity of the virus and potentially endanger the health of those around him, holding a campaign rally on Monday.

Seven months after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global pandemic, life is closer to normal in the Asia-Pacific region thanks to the basic lessons of epidemiology: clear communication, quarantines, border controls, aggressive testing and contact tracing, Kenji Shibuya, the Director of the Institute for Population Health at King's College London, told CNN.

European countries with successful pandemic responses, like Germany, have taken this approach.

But experts say Spain, the US and the UK are seeing cases skyrocket, and cracks appear in the political and public consensus, after they opted to prematurely re-open their economies without heeding those rules.

Spain's government declared a state of emergency on Friday in the country's worst-hit Madrid region, in order to override regional leaders' objections to the restrictions. In the UK, Johnson's muddled messaging and a lack of transparency in decision-making have drawn criticism from across the political spectrum

But instead of taking stock of their failures and looking at a sustainable way forward, an Anglo-American narrative has grown, suggesting it is too late to try to emulate Asia-Pacific nations, said Dr. Tim Colbourn, a global health epidemiology and evaluation lecturer at University College London. Libertarian think-pieces, open letters and politicians across the Atlantic have advocated -- with little scientific merit -- for governments to ""give up restrictions and let it [Covid-19] spread"" for the sake of the economy, Colbourn said.

Thousands of revelers gathered at an open air water park in the Chinese city of Wuhan, ground zero of the pandemic, for an electronic music festival in August.

This is a maddening idea to the vast majority of health professionals and scientists, who point to Covid-19's high fatality rate and its long-term effects on survivors.

""When countries [like the US and UK] experience declining life expectancy, it really should be a red flag,"" said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Deteriorating health in populations has electoral consequences, McKee told CNN -- adding that historically, those factors caused ""populism and then you get state failure.""

Classic epidemiology

Resurgences of Covid-19 in the Asia-Pacific region look a lot different to what is happening in the West. New Zealand pretty much eradicated community transmission within its borders after a minor outbreak in August, during which the virus' spread never rose beyond 19 new infections a day.

Border controls have been effective, says Shibuya. Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand have largely kept their borders closed to visitors, with returning citizens and work permit holders being quarantined at home or at designated facilities.

The same is true in Vietnam, which remains closed to most international travelers and, like many countries in the region, has encouraged citizens to holiday within its borders. The lower-middle income country has taken a proactive approach to the outbreak, bringing infections down to the single digits in October, little more than two months after authorities evacuated 80,000 local tourists from the resort city of Da Nang after three residents tested positive for the virus.

By contrast, the European Union resumed inter-regional tourism in June, even though many European countries were slow to require visitors to undergo routine testing on arrival.

The United Nations' tourism agency, the UNWTO, found that ""Europe is the region in which more destinations (81%) have eased travel restrictions"" while only 28% of destinations in the Asia-Pacific region had eased border controls by September 1, according to its analysis of travel restrictions

Taiwan and South Korea, which had the world's second highest number of cases in February, kept a handle on outbreaks without blunt instruments like lockdowns thanks to their gold standard test and tracing systems, and a transparent communication strategy that has kept the public on side.

The UK deploys conventional contact-tracing methods, which identify cases and track down the people they met after they became infectious, says McKee. Meanwhile, Asian countries like South Korea have relied on what is known as backwards tracing, which attempts to identify the event, place or source of an infection.

A worker sprays sprays hand sanitiser onto passengers as they arrive at Taoyuan Airport in Taiwan.

""Was it the churches in Germany, our packing plants or a nightclub in Korea?"" Mckee said, adding that instead of focusing on the source of infection, the UK has ""hit whole communities with a hammer"" of localized lockdowns without consulting local leaders. He says such measures are appropriate ""if you don't have intelligence"" on the source of an outbreak, but adds: ""The UK should not be in that position at this stage.""

Even the economic situation looks less stark. The IMF forecasts that the economy in the Asia-Pacific region will contract by 0.2% this year, while those in US and Western Europe are expected to sink by 5.9% and 7.3% respectively.

Cultural tropes

Asia-Pacific's response has been shaped by the 2003 SARS outbreak. Trauma from that period meant many Asian countries were better prepared and better resourced to act decisively at start of the pandemic with public approval.

But a common, and orientalist, refrain has emerged from the Western commentariat that more draconian measures and -- arguably sensible -- rules on mask wearing would be impossible to mandate on freedom-loving Anglo-Americans.

Countries like Norway and the Netherlands recommend masks in indoor public spaces, but do not mandate it. Swedish authorities have actively discouraged the use of masks, despite the high number of Covid-19 deaths in care homes,

As well as resorting to lazy cultural tropes, such as Trump's immediate racialization of the outbreak by calling coronavirus the ""China virus,"" American and British leaders have also repeatedly undermined guidance and best practice.

Though he has since changed tack, in March Johnson said he shook hands ""with everybody"" during a visit to a hospital treating confirmed Covid-19 patients, on the same day the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies advocated against the practice. Trump has turned masks into a hyper-partisan issue, routinely mocking Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for wearing a face covering.

US President Donald Trump removes his mask on his return to the White House from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where he was treated for coronavirus.

Communication strategies are an underestimated ""non-pharmaceutical intervention"" which are not only useful in the short term -- by encouraging measures like mask usage -- but have long-term uses as well, says Heidi Tworek, an associate professor of international history and public policy at the University of British Columbia, who authored a report on democratic communications during the pandemic.

The report analyzed three democratic jurisdictions in the Asia-Pacific region -- Taiwan, New Zealand, and South Korea -- and found that cohesive messages from those governments were useful in forestalling ""compliance fatigue"" and laid the foundation for vaccine uptake. ""They also matter for cultivating trust among citizens and their governments -- trust that is critical for the future stability of democratic institutions,"" the report stated.

Winning trust

That trust can easily be lost. A study in The Lancet found that when Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, broke lockdown rules but faced no consequences, it undermined the public's faith in the government's ability to handle the pandemic. The opposite happened in New Zealand, where David Clark, its Health Minister, was demoted in April 2020 after twice breaking the country's Covid-19 regulations. He resigned in July and goodwill for the government has remained.

Taiwan's government deployed a cartoon spokesdog to help communicate its social distancing policy.

New Zealand and South Korea adopted a ""division-of-labour approach to communicating political and scientific information,"" the report noted. Public health officials would first deliver the science. The message would be humanized and reinforced with meaning by politicians like New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern or South Korea's President Moon Jae-on in televised addresses or Facebook lives, Tworek said.

Misinformation and conspiracies were tackled in South Korea and Taiwan via high quality information being pushed out on multiple channels, Tworek added. To engage the public, the Taiwanese government worked with local comedians to create memes for their ""humor over rumor"" strategy. It included the use of a cartoon ""spokesdog,"" a Shiba Inu called Zongchai, to help communicate its policies. One meme showed that the 1.5 meter indoor social distancing policy equated to the length of three Shiba Inu, while the outdoor social distancing policy was two Shiba Inu.

Masks were distributed to Taiwanese households at the start of the pandemic -- many of them in a shade of pink. After hearing that male students were being bullied for wearing pink masks at schools, officials wore pink face coverings at their daily briefing. ""It is fantastic because it's not just about countering disinformation, it is about countering stigma and prejudice,"" Tworek said. ""This is not rocket science. These are basic tenets of health and risk communications [in order to] establish trust.""

Have an upcoming election in the pandemic? Asian democracies also have a solution to that. South Korea saw its highest turnout in April's poll as voters wore masks and gloves, polling booths were disinfected, and people spaced out as they queued to vote. In the US, officials are turning large venues and sports centers into polling stations in order to accommodate social distancing concerns in November's poll.

New Zealand and Hong Kong postponed elections over the summer, citing coronavirus fears. While the main New Zealand opposition party backed the move, some pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong claimed the government was using the pandemic as an excuse to avoid potential losses in a crucial election.

America's largest roadblock remains its President, who has repeatedly called into question the integrity of the democratic process by undermining the safest way to hand in a ballot in a pandemic: Mail-in voting.

As Trump continues to downplay the threat of the virus, another 20,000 Covid-19 deaths are ""inevitable"" by the end of the month, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Tom Frieden, told CNN this weekend.

At least 21 percent of the U.S. population has access to one of the official COVID-19 contact-tracing apps developed by various state governments, but only a fraction of people actually use them.



Advertisement

And that’s the inherent problem with these kinds of apps: Enough people must use them for them to be at all effective . I get why there’s so much trepidation: There’s still a lot we don’t know about COVID-19; tech companies have a terrible track record with data privacy; government surveillance is a real threat; and America’s current political and social climate is challenging (to put it mildly). People are naturally going to be skeptical in the face of so many questions and concerns.

So l et’s focus on what we do know about the latest contact-tracing apps.

The tech protects user privacy



Eleven U.S. states, plus Guam, have official contact-tracing apps available now. Ten more have announced plans to release their own, including California and Arizona, two states with apps currently in beta testing . Most of the state-developed apps use contact-tracing technology that is now built into the latest versions of Android and iOS by default.

Instead of using geographic data or wifi, these apps ping nearby devices using a low-power Bluetooth signal—without sharing any personal data. If one user tests positive, the app sends an alert to all of the devices that were close enough to register each other; none of the tracing or contacting is done based on name, phone number, or other personally-identifying information.

iPhones and Android phones can do this by default, so developers don’t need to create their own tracing technology. In fact, many contact-tracing apps are open-source, meaning the code is freely available and readable by anyone.

Your phone still needs an app

While its true that Android and iOS now have built-in contact-tracing capabilities, those features are different from the functions of the apps themselves. Your phone still needs a contact-tracing app in order to use those features, and such an app will not just mysteriously show up on your device. No one is forcing you to use them.

Advertisement

Even if you believe that these apps are spying on everyone, the argument falls short given all the information you already surrender to various companies (including Apple and Google) simply by using their hardware, software, and services. Companies (and governments) don’t need to hide their data collection behind a contact-tracing app. They’re already doing it right out in the open.

Scams and malware are a bigger issue

It’s true the initial wave of contact-tracing apps was rife with privacy issues. Some of these security flaws were accidental; others were deliberate. However, most of these occurred before Apple and Google rolled out their contact-tracing APIs, and are entirely unrelated.



Advertisement

There were also reports of “contact-tracing” arrests after protests—which is a serious issue—but it’s more accurate to call those “social-engineering” arrests; the police weren’t using data from contact-tracing apps to make arrests. Low-level Bluetooth tracing can confirm that devices pinged one another, but no useful identifying info can be gleaned from that.

That said, independent developers are still free to use different methods of tracing if they choose, and that’s where things get shady. Coronavirus scams and malicious apps are on the rise. Hackers and identity thieves will definitely try to dupe you into fake contact-tracing apps and websites. As long as you’re using an official open-source app from your state, one that uses the APIs built into your phone for contact-tracing, there’s little to worry about. Or, to frame it differently, the benefits you’ll experience from knowing that you were potentially exposed to a life-threatening disease should far outweigh any other concerns you might have.","['theres', 'covid19', 'app', 'tracing', 'latest', 'contacttracing', 'dont', 'data', 'work', 'apps', 'official', 'actually', 'using', 'phone']"

On late Monday night, the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson put a temporary pause on all of its clinical trials of experimental vaccines for the coronavirus that causes covid-19, following the report of an “unexplained illness” in one of the study participants. It’s not yet clear whether the person’s illness is connected to the vaccine, nor the exact nature of their ailment.

Advertisement

The pause was first reported by STAT News, an hour before the company announced the decision. According to J&J, the volunteer had been participating in the EMSEMBLE Phase III trial, the last stage of research testing out the vaccine candidate, which uses a weakened version of a common adenovirus as its delivery method. This adenovirus is modified to express a key protein of the coronavirus, hopefully fooling the immune system into building up a defense against the real thing. The dummy virus is also neutered to prevent it from replicating in the human body.

Large clinical trials routinely have safety measures, including temporary pauses, that kick in when someone becomes sick from something that could be related to the experimental treatment. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that this illness is truly connected to the vaccine. Typically, as is the case here, an independent review board of experts will examine the incident and decide on the next course of action. In its announcement, the company also stated that its own scientists and physicians will also be reviewing the matter.

However, at this point, no further information concerning the patient is being made available.

“We must respect this participant’s privacy. We’re also learning more about this participant’s illness, and it’s important to have all the facts before we share additional information,” the company said.

This isn’t the first pause of a vaccine trial for covid-19. Once in July and once in September, the UK company AstraZeneca paused clinical trials of its candidate, another adenovirus-based vaccine, after two participants developed neurological symptoms. Following an independent review, according to the company, both incidents “were either considered unlikely to be associated with the vaccine or there was insufficient evidence to say for certain that the illnesses were or were not related to the vaccine.” However, though AstraZeneca has since resumed its clinical trials in the UK and elsewhere, it has not received the go-ahead from the Food and Drug Administration to do so yet in the U.S., and outside experts have questioned whether the company has been transparent enough about these adverse events to rule out any possible connection to its candidate vaccine.

Adverse events are entirely expected as part of any large clinical trial and not always caused by the drug or vaccine being studied , and pauses to trials are not necessarily the death knell of an experimental treatment. If anything, these pauses indicate the clinical trial process is working as intended, flagging potential harms before they reach the general public. Whatever ends up happening, it’s a reminder that the road to a successful vaccine for covid-19 will have its bumps and potholes.","['coronavirus', 'clinical', 'participants', 'company', 'pause', 'pauses', 'trials', 'vaccine', 'unexplained', 'johnson', 'volunteer', 'trial', 'illness']"

A novel and controversial vaccine trial for covid-19 is officially set to begin in the UK next January. On Tuesday, researchers from the Imperial College London and elsewhere announced that they plan to conduct a human challenge trial that will involve 90 young and healthy adults. These volunteers will be given experimental vaccines and be intentionally infected with the coronavirus that causes covid-19, all while under observation by doctors.

In late September, the Financial Times reported that the UK would allow these trials to begin next year, noting the involvement of Imperial College London and other partners. But no partner confirmed the news on the record; some said that the status of the project was in flux. Now, many of its details have been laid out, though the experiment will still need to be formally approved by an ethics committee.

According to the announcement, the project will recruit and pay volunteers between the ages of 18 and 30. The first phase of the trial will simply try to figure out the smallest possible dose of virus needed to successfully infect someone; subsequent experiments will test out several vaccine candidates. The tests will be conducted at the Royal Free Hospital, with the study expected to last until May, though volunteers will be monitored for a year in full.

Though human challenge trials have long been part of the toolkit of clinical research, including for testing out new vaccines, some scientists have been critical of their potential use for covid-19. Unlike other diseases studied through human challenge trials, much remains unknown how covid-19 can affect even young and healthy people, they’ve argued. And the still widely spreading pandemic ironically reduces the need for challenge trials , which are often used to study diseases that are rare or difficult to track. There are already several vaccines very far ahead in clinical testing, and scientists hope that the large-scale trial results needed to secure regulatory approval for their use will emerge at the end of the year.

However, proponents have argued that these first-generation vaccines, even if successful, may not be the most effective ones that we’re capable of producing, so it’s important to keep developing and testing out potential candidates. And while challenge trials do carry their own unique risks, the opportunity to track the full course of infection in people in a controlled environment is something no other type of study can provide.

“Deliberately infecting volunteers with a known human pathogen is never undertaken lightly. However, such studies are enormously informative about a disease,” said study investigator Peter Openshaw, an immunologist at Imperial College London, in a press release. “It is really vital that we move as fast as possible towards getting effective vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19, and challenge studies have the potential to accelerate and de-risk the development of novel drugs and vaccines.”

The project will be conducted with the help of the UK government as well as the company hVIVO, which has previously worked on human challenge trials. The UK government is expected to spend $43.4 million USD to fund the project, per the AP.","['challenge', 'vaccines', 'coronavirus', 'covid19', 'infect', 'study', 'project', 'volunteers', 'uk', 'trials', 'vaccine', 'human', 'intentionally', 'trial']"

On Thursday, the United States reported over 77,000 new cases of covid-19, according to a tally maintained by NBC News—a record high. The rising numbers in new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, both in the U.S. and throughout the world, signal the resurgence of a viral pandemic that has already claimed over 220,000 American lives and 1.1 million lives globally.

Per NBC News, the U.S. saw a reported 77,640 new cases Thursday, eclipsing the previous high mark of 75,723 in late July, as well as 921 related deaths.

Different trackers use slightly different periods of time as their cutoff for the day and may not rely on the same sources of data, so these numbers aren’t necessarily definitive. But all of the tracking indicates a clear upturn in the shape of the pandemic. The COVID Tracking Project, for instance, reported around 73,000 new cases and 1,038 deaths Thursday—the first time their death toll has reached over 1,000 since late September.

Many countries are experiencing their own record surges. France, Germany, and the Czech Republic are among the several that have recently reported a new record in daily cases. Even some countries that have largely managed the coronavirus effectively up to now are starting to slip, such as Malaysia and Myanmar. According to data from the World Health Organization, Wednesday saw a new record high in reported cases worldwide, with over 443,000.

Much of the world is now experiencing its second wave of the pandemic, following a lengthy period of low incidence during the northern hemisphere summer. The U.S., however, has only briefly reported significant lulls in new cases since March, making this most recent surge more akin to a third peak during a single first wave. Only a few regions of the country have avoided a troubling increase in new cases, though some previously hard-hit areas are still far off their previous peaks, such as New York. Many of these new cases have been concentrated in rural areas of the Midwest.

The somewhat good news: Compared to the start of the pandemic, doctors and hospitals now have some treatments available for severe cases of covid-19, as well as standardized protocols that appear to be lessening the odds of needing invasive and risky interventions like ventilators. These improvements, some recent research has suggested, may be significantly driving down the mortality rate of covid-19. But other experts have argued that this drop in the fatality rate is less pronounced than it seems, and mostly due to other factors like the average age of patients lowering and hospitals not being as overwhelmed as they were during their respective peaks. Yesterday, the FDA approved the first specific treatment for covid-19, the anti-viral remdesivir, but there is no solid evidence that the drug can prevent deaths and only weak evidence that it can shorten the length of symptoms.

Unfortunately, these favorable circumstances seem to be in danger of fading away. Hard-hit areas are once again reporting shortages of hospital and intensive care unit beds as well as concerns about their supply of respirators and other essential medical equipment. And outbreaks involving predominantly older people are also on the rise.

Experts have warned for months that the weather conditions of the fall and winter would be especially dangerous for the spread of the viral illness in the U.S. The fact that we’re already seeing record numbers so early into the season could be a grim foreshadowing of how much worse things could get. And unlike earlier in the year, the White House no longer seems to be interested in pretending to root for anyone but the virus.","['hit', 'coronavirus', 'covid19', 'pandemic', 'reported', 'viral', 'high', 'world', 'numbers', 'lives', 'record', 'daily', 'cases']"

But for people whose work can only be done in person, or who lack a financial buffer, “this could be a huge deal,” he said. “They could lose their paycheck. They could lose their job.”

Caregivers, too, may find themselves put in a precarious position by false positives, which could force them to separate from children, older family members or other vulnerable contacts. Should another person need to come in and take their place, the risks of exposure to the virus could increase for all involved.

And for facilities with limited space, placing a person in unnecessary isolation could shift equipment, medical care and even follow-up tests away from someone who might need those resources more.

New outbreaks

Under certain circumstances, a false positive could seed new coronavirus cases. Crowded facilities, such as nursing homes, prisons or hospitals, might isolate coronavirus-positive people together.

In a worst-case scenario, “if someone isn’t actually positive, we could be sending them to their death,” said Dr. Valerie Fitzhugh, a pathologist at Rutgers University.

In early October, officials in Nevada ordered the state’s nursing homes to halt the use of two rapid coronavirus tests until further notice, citing concerns about accuracy. (Nearly 40 percent of the country’s known Covid-19 deaths have come from nursing homes, according to an analysis by The New York Times.) A rash of false positives had been uncovered, according to the directive, which had risked placing uninfected residents into units with infected people, giving the coronavirus more opportunity to spread. Such a scenario “could result in causing harm to a population that we have collectively worked so hard to protect,” officials noted in a follow-up directive. Under pressure from the federal government, Nevada officials revoked the rapid testing prohibition on Oct. 9.

Missed or inappropriate treatment

False positives can also be disastrous from a treatment standpoint, said Linoj Samuel, a clinical microbiologist at Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. People with the flu or Covid-19, for example, often show similar symptoms, but may only be tested for one of them at a time. If a patient is given an incorrect diagnosis of Covid-19, that person could be deprived of treatment that could alleviate their illness, or be given a costly therapy that does little to speed their recovery.","['concern', 'false', 'homes', 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'treatment', 'officials', 'person', 'tests', 'positives', 'merit', 'nursing']"

NBC News reported Monday that Redfield was overheard during a phone call in public on a commercial airline to say, ""Everything he says is false."" NBC News, which heard the comment, said Redfield acknowledged after the flight from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., that he was speaking about Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist who joined the White House Coronavirus Task Force in August.

NBC said that Redfield, in a conversation with a colleague that took place on Friday, suggested Atlas is providing Trump with misleading data about the efficacy of masks, young people's susceptibility to the coronavirus and herd immunity.

In a statement to CNN, a CDC spokesman did not deny the conversation took place: ""NBC News is reporting one side of a private phone conversation by CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield that was overheard on a plane from Atlanta Hartsfield airport. Dr. Redfield was having a private discussion regarding a number of points he has made publicly about Covid-19.""



In a statement sent Monday afternoon, the CDC acknowledged Redfield and Atlas have ""different positions"" on some issues: ""The article quotes Dr. Redfield as saying ""Everything he says is false"" but it cannot supply the context for that statement since only one side of the private conversation being eavesdropped on was heard. Positions on three issues, the value of wearing a mask, youth COVID-19 infections, and where we are currently with herd immunity, are the positions that Dr. Redfield has different positions on than Dr. Atlas. The doctors agree on many other issues.""



A federal health official tells CNN, more broadly, ""bottomline, the story is accurate.""



In response to CNN about Redfield's reported comments on Atlas, White House spokesperson Sarah Matthews said in a statement, ""The President consults with many experts both inside and outside of the federal government, who sometimes disagree with one another. He then makes policy decisions based on all of the information to save lives and safely reopen the country. Everyone, including the president, recommends wearing a mask when you cannot social distance.""

On Thursday morning, Trump called into Fox Business to speak with Maria Bartiromo about his coronavirus symptoms, quarantine, and his upcoming debate with Joe Biden, which is scheduled for Oct. 15.

After Trump tested positive for COVID-19 last week the status and formatting of future presidential debates was thrown into question. Hours after Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence's debate on Wednesday, however, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced that the next presidential debate would be held virtually, which Trump doesn't approve of.

""I heard that the commission a little while ago changed the debate style and that's not acceptable to us,"" Trump said on Fox. ""I'm not going to do a virtual debate. I'm not going to waste my time on a virtual debate. That's not what debating's all about — you sit behind a computer and do a debate. That's ridiculous. And then they cut you off whenever they want.""

Trump's campaign also released an official statement in which they stated that ""canceling an in-person debate is pathetic"" and rather than partake in a virtual debate they'll hold an in-person rally.

The Biden campaign initially said that Joe would be happy to take part in a virtual debate, but after learning of Trump's refusal to participate they released a second statement saying that Biden ""will find an appropriate place to take questions from voters directly on October 15th, as he has done on several occasions in recent weeks.""

Trump's refusal to partake in a virtual debate comes less than a week after his positive COVID-19 diagnosis was announced. He was admitted to Walter Reed Medical Center on Friday, where he was treated for three days before returning to the White House on Monday night. Along with Trump, the first lady and several members of Trump's administration — including senior aide Hope Hicks , and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany — have also tested positive for the virus.

Both Pence and Harris reportedly tested negative for COVID-19 before Wednesday's debate. However, Pence's previous close contact with Trump and people like Katie Miller — his communications director and the wife of Trump's senior advisor Stephen Miller, who tested positive for the virus on Tuesday — inspired the Commission on Presidential Debates to take additional safety precautions during the debate. Everyone in the audience was required to wear face masks for the duration of the event and two plexiglass dividers were placed between Harris and Pence on stage.

Despite COVID-19 making its way through the White House staff, Trump and his team have continued to play down the severity of the deadly virus. On Monday night Trump told his Twitter followers not to be afraid of COVID-19 , even though its killed more than 210,000 Americans to date.

And prior to the VP debate, Pence's team tried to oppose the presence of the plexiglass barriers on stage , but they eventually agreed.

Meanwhile, Harris like Biden, consistently wears a mask in public, encourages the American people to do the same, and argues that we must take the virus seriously.

The vice presidential debate tonight between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris looks set to go ahead, despite Pence’s recent exposure to people who later tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Given the pitiful precautions enacted to prevent transmission of the aerosol-spread virus—tiny plexiglass barriers, who do you think you are protecting?—it’s worth wondering: Did the coronavirus plan this debate? And is the coronavirus now controlling President Trump via tiny levers and buttons in his brain?

Advertisement

For starters, there’s the very normal President Trump, fresh off three days of hospitalization. To date, there remains no clear indication of when or how Trump contracted the infection, nor detailed information about the current state of his health and the risk of infection he poses to others (on Wednesday afternoon, a memo signed by his attending doctor claimed that Trump had been symptom-free for more than 24 hours, but Trump himself has not made a public appearance since Monday night). His recent tweets are, again, very normal.

More than two dozen White House officials or close political allies to Trump have recently tested positive for the coronavirus, including former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (currently hospitalized), Utah senator Mike Lee, and longtime consultant Kellyanne Conway. Many of these people attended the September 26 event at the White House Rose Garden where Trump announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. This Rose Garden meeting of over 200 people is now thought to have been a super-spreading event for the virus.

Vice President Mike Pence was also in attendance that day, though the White House claims that Pence continues to test negative for covid-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cleared Pence for the debate. However, Pence seems to be openly flouting the public health guidelines established by that very same CDC, which calls for individuals to isolate for at least 14 days and practice physical distancing from others following exposure to people with confirmed covid-19.

While it’s impossible to truly know how many people were infectious that day at the Rose Garden, Pence directly sat in front of Mike Lee during the announcement, and he sat across from Kellyanne Conway and Melania Trump, another confirmed positive. Other experts have speculated that Pence was also likely in close contact with Donald Trump himself days prior to his first known symptoms last week, a period of time when infected individuals are contagious.

Following Trump’s hospitalization, the Biden/Harris campaign called for the plexiglass to be installed as an additional safety measure during the debate—a measure Pence openly mocked, even as the President was hospitalized. After a few days of back-and-forth, Pence’s camp relented on Tuesday.

Advertisement

In truth, though, the plexiglass is more theater than security. Solid barriers like face shields are most effective at blocking droplets expelled at close range. The candidates will be 12 feet apart from each other, twice the distance that droplets tend to travel before falling to the ground. The more worrying risk is that tiny aerosols containing the virus can linger in the air and waft over into the mouth or nose of an uninfected person. A small plexiglass barrier is likely no more useful at stopping these aerosols than a tennis racket would be at catching bubbles.

Pence still testing negative is an encouraging sign that he doesn’t have covid-19, but an infection can sometimes take a week or longer to develop, and false negatives on a covid-19 test remain relatively common up to the day that symptoms start. Plus, the White House has clearly been dishonest about test results in the past.

Advertisement

The good-ish news is that even if Pence or Harris is infected and contagious on the debate stage tonight, it’s not a guarantee that they would transmit the virus to one another. Most infections are still thought to be caused through close contact with droplets and/or aerosols, not through long-range aerosols.

At the same time, the Commission on Presidential Debates doesn’t seem to be taking further steps against preventing airborne transmission, such as installing relatively cheap air filters or even just building a more secure plexiglass barrier with more than one wall for the virus to sidestep. And no one on either side seems to be pushing for simply having the debate conducted remotely, by far the safest option that would make all of this guesswork completely irrelevant.

That brings us back to the big question. The President and Pence, the head of the White House’s coronavirus task force, seem to be doing as little as they possibly can to stop the virus from spreading amon g their own staff and allies— a microcosm of the administration’s failing response to a pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 Americans . Trump himself told people not to fear the virus on Monday, even as he is currently receiving multiple experimental treatments and a steroid after falling alarmingly ill days earlier.

If the mastermind operative of the Trump 2020 campaign is a trillion coronaviruses stacked on top of each other in a trench coat, well, at least all of this would make sense.","['debate', 'pence', 'vice', 'coronavirus', 'virus', 'president', 'mike', 'presidential', 'days', 'white', 'trump', 'plexiglass', 'plan']"

Asking whether you could be suffering from smoke exposure or covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, sounds like a horrible joke. However, it is an unfortunate reality in Colorado and other states that are experiencing wildfire hell right now. In response, Colorado officials have one message: Get tested.

Advertisement

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis advised residents that are experiencing symptoms such as a cough or a sore throat to get tested for covid-19 this week. In a news conference, he expressed concern that the impact of the fires on respiratory conditions could mask the spread of the virus. Polis stated that Colorado has more than 80 free covid-19 testing sites available.

Advertisement

“The early symptoms of covid look a lot like breathing bad air for a period of hours and then, of course, the difference is, in some cases, covid significantly worsens over the next few days,” Polis said, per the Coloradoan.

Firefighting crews across Colorado have been battling fierce wildfires for weeks. As of Saturday, two of the most serious were the Cameron Peak Fire (207,000 acres) and the East Troublesome Fire (188,000 acres).

G/O Media may get a commission Sony WH-1000XM4 $218 at Backmarket Use the promo code Kinja2020

Polis’ advice is not without reason. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, respiratory symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat and difficulty breathing are common to both wildfire smoke exposure and covid-19.

In fact, the CDC has dedicated web pages for people seeking information on wildfire smoke and covid-19, which offer advice on the differences between smoke exposure symptoms and covid-19, mask usage during wildfire smoke exposure and considerations for cleaner air shelters, among other topics.

Advertisement

“Hopefully, it’s just the smoke and the fires, and you’ll be better when that resolves,” Polis said at the conference. “But you owe it to yourself, the safety of your family and others, because in some cases that could, in fact, be coronavirus.”

As if dealing with wildfires and covid-19 weren’t bad enough, public health officials warn that smoke exposure could make the pandemic worse. In an interview with the New York Times in July, Sarah Henderson, senior environmental health scientist at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, said smoke particles do a number on the human body.

Advertisement

“When your immune system is overwhelmed by particles, it’s not going to do such a good job fighting other things, like viruses,” she said.

Advertisement

On one hand, smoke particles affect the body’s cilia, or hair-like projections that keep unwanted things out of our lungs. This makes it harder to clear out viruses, per the Times. And on the other hand, smoke and covid-19 can greatly affect the body’s respiratory and cardiovascular systems.

The CDC is equally bleak on the matter. The agency states that exposure to air pollutants in wildfire smoke can “irritate the lungs, cause inflammation, alter immune function and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections, likely including covid-19.” It added that recent studies suggest that air pollutant exposure worsens the disease’s symptoms and outcomes.

Advertisement

So if you’re in Colorado or another area experiencing wildfires, what can you do to stay safe from smoke exposure during the pandemic? To minimize potential health impacts from wildfire smoke, the CDC says the best way is to reduce smoke exposure. One way of doing this is by finding a cleaner air shelter or cleaner air space. These are short and long-term public spaces, such as school gyms, civic auditoriums and libraries, meant to provide relief from wildfire smoke.

Nonetheless, the CDC acknowledges that it could be hard to find a shelter or space right now because of the pandemic, which has closed many public facilities or forced them to operate with limited capacity. If you can’t get to one of these spaces, the agency recommends creating a cleaner air space at home.

Advertisement

To create a cleaner air space, use a portable air cleaner in one or more rooms. These devices work best when run continuously with the doors and windows closed. If you have a forced air system, consider having a professional install a filter, which must be HEPA, MERV-13 or higher, to reduce indoor smoke. For these systems, the CDC also adds that it’s best that the settings are set to “recirculate” and “on” instead of “auto.”

Advertisement

Unfortunately, although cloth face masks are some of our most important tools in the fight against covid-19, they won’t be of much help against the harmful air pollutants in wildfire smoke. This is because they don’t capture the smallest particles in smoke, the CDC maintains. N95 masks do provide protection from wildfire smoke, but they might be hard to find right now because we’re in a pandemic that broke single-day records for new infections two days in row this past week.

Another thing to consider: N95 masks are considered critical supplies that the federal officials stress must be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders.

Besides wildfires and covid-19, Colorado is also expecting a blizzard this weekend. While that may sound like just too much, many in the state are hoping the snow will provide them with some relief from the wildfires. In that case, please, let it snow.","['covid19', 'exposure', 'wildfire', 'cdc', 'wildfires', 'tested', 'colorado', 'cleaner', 'symptoms', 'urges', 'smoke', 'air']"

The White House held an event honoring Gold Star families indoors, in the East Room, with no social distancing and few masks on the evening of Sunday, September 27. That gathering came one day after a Supreme Court event in the Rose Garde n, where multiple attendees have subsequently tested positive. And it came after months of blatant disregard for basic public health guidance inside the White House, ultimately putting West Wing and residence staff and the President himself in direct risk of catching the virus

""I got a lot of things doing. And again, when I want to say hello to Gold Star families, what I -- I'm not going to be in a basement saying, 'Hey I can't see you as you traveled in from California and all the different places.' It's OK,"" Trump said Thursday morning during a call-in interview on Fox Business.

""And I think at some point I would -- it's a very -- look, it's a tiny, tiny it's like a tiny little microscopic piece of dust. It gets into nose your mouth or your eye, frankly, or something else or you touch something. So, I understand, and then you get better,"" he added.

The comments go further than Trump's previous suggestion during an interview with Fox News after senior adviser Hope Hicks' diagnosis that Hicks contracted the virus from a member of the military or law enforcement.

""It's very, very hard when you are with people from the military or from law enforcement, and they come over to you and they want to hug you and they want to kiss you because we really have done a good job for them. And you get close and things happen,"" Trump told Sean Hannity hours before his diagnosis was publicly disclosed.

There's no way to say conclusively how Trump and others contracted the virus, and just because someone tested positive sooner than someone else does not mean they were responsible for the infection.

The White House placed a high reliance on unreliable rapid antigen tests, but has not put similar effort into rapid contact tracing to determine potential spread. Trump held numerous events actively shirking social distancing and mask wearing in the days, weeks and months before his infection, many of which were indoors. And hundreds of officials who were not in daily contact with the President, but regularly interact with key officials who were, were not regularly tested.

The White House has declined to provide a full list of attendees in the East Room, but CNN has reached out to some of the families and organizations known to be in attendance.

Timothy Davis, the president and CEO of the Greatest GENERATIONS Foundation, said in a statement that all Gold Star Family attendees were tested by the White House ahead of the event, and, like the Supreme Court event, all tested negative for coronavirus. The rapid antigen tests administered by the White House are known to deliver a high rate of false negatives.

""Considering it has been 12-days since the event, All Gold Star family are all doing well and exhibit no symptoms of Covid-19,"" Davis said in the statement, adding that the group is providing a ""daily update"" to the White House Office of Public Liaison.

Though the White House has claimed all contact tracing is complete , New York Times White House correspondent and CNN contributor Michael Shear, who tested positive for the virus following direct interaction with White House officials, told CNN late Tuesday that there's been no outreach by the White House to do contact tracing or to follow up on his condition. And at least one other White House official told CNN that they've also alerted officials that they have had direct contact with positive White House personnel, and received no guidance on how to proceed.

That Trump would place blame on Gold Star families says much about his general attitude toward the solemn club of military families who have lost a son, daughter, brother, sister, husband, wife, father or mother.

During the 2016 election, Trump went after Khizr Khan, whose son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, died in Iraq in 2004, after Khan spoke out against Trump at the Democratic National Convention.

""Who wrote that? Did Hillary's script writers write it?"" Trump said in an interview at the time . ""I think I've made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard.""

Trump also repeatedly attacked Sen. John McCain, who, he said, was ""not a war hero,"" despite being captured in Vietnam and tortured as a prisoner of war.","['coronavirus', 'event', 'star', 'house', 'white', 'contact', 'trump', 'tested', 'cnn', 'gold', 'infection', 'appears', 'families', 'blame']"

The drug has long been used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. At the start of the pandemic, a handful of small, poorly designed studies suggested that it could block the coronavirus from replicating in cells.

Since then, the data on hydroxychloroquine’s effectiveness against the virus has been mixed. The early, seemingly promising results, bolstered by political pressure, prompted the Food and Drug Administration to grant the drug an emergency authorization for use in very sick Covid-19 patients. Follow-up studies, however, found the drug neither sped recovery nor prevented healthy people from contracting the coronavirus or progressing to serious disease.

The F.D.A. ultimately revoked its emergency approval. The agency now warns that hydroxychloroquine can cause dangerous abnormalities in heart rhythm in coronavirus patients. Researchers have also conducted large reviews concluding that hydroxychloroquine does not benefit Covid-19 patients, and have reaffirmed the risks of side effects in these individuals.","['conversation', 'studies', 'drug', 'coronavirus', 'emergency', 'covid19', 'warns', 'virus', 'patients', 'online', 'used', 'hydroxychloroquine']"

Donors that gave $250,000 were able to participate in a roundtable, photo opportunity and reception with the President, according to the event invite. The roundtable included 18 donors, according to a source, and was held indoors at socially-distanced tables.

Another source says that the attendees at the roundtable were tested for coronavirus when they arrived and that no one wore masks.

Three attendees told CNN that most people at the events were not wearing masks; all three say they have not been contacted by any contact tracers.

The President announced he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for coronavirus roughly eight hours after leaving the fundraiser, when he was back at the White House.

CNN has obscured a portion of this document to block an email address.

The decision to travel and participate in the fundraiser despite the knowledge of being exposed to the coronavirus is another example of the White House and administration's lackadaisical approach to mask wearing and Covid-19 prevention policies.

An hour and a half before the fundraiser, some senior staff and the President were informed Hope Hicks had tested positive for coronavirus, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters on Friday.

The decision was made to still hold the fundraiser despite Trump's exposure; attendees say they were not notified the President had been exposed to Covid-19.

Arriving at 2:33 p.m., the President then attended the indoor and outdoor events.

If donors gave, or raised, $50,000, they were invited to a photo opportunity with Trump.

The two attendees from Texas who participated in the photo opportunity said they had been tested for coronavirus before arriving at the VIP reception where they took their photo with the President.

They said each individually conversed with Trump for less than a minute while the photo was taken and maintained six feet of distance. The attendees at the VIP reception did not wear masks, they said, but event staff did.

The third event the President participated in was an outdoor reception open to all donors. New Jersey resident Katherine Hermes told CNN that Trump stood at a podium, socially distant from the attendees, and held a question and answer session.

She and the Texas attendees say they were kept in two groups, separated by barricades.

Questions asked by the donors ranged from why there had not been arrests and criminal prosecutions of leading Democrats to campaign strategy, according to Hermes. In response to the question about arrests and prosecutions, she remembers Trump responding that there was so much he couldn't tell the crowd.

The group closer to the President had been tested for coronavirus; Hermes' group was only present for the outdoor reception and only received temperature checks and was kept further away.

The two groups did not intermingle and most attendees in both groups were not wearing masks, according to Hermes and the Texas attendees.

Campaign emailed attendees after President tests positive

On Friday at noon, the Trump campaign emailed attendees officially notifying them the President tested positive for coronavirus.

""We unfortunately write today to notify you that, as you have probably seen, President Trump confirmed late last night that he and the First Lady were tested for COVID-19 and produced positive test results,"" the email, obtained by CNN, reads. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we want to call this to your attention.""

The email went on to encourage attendees to contact their medical provider if they, or their loved ones, develop Covid-19 symptoms. It did not make any mention of quarantining or self-isolation but did recommend attendees visit the CDC's website

On Twitter , New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy recommended that fundraiser attendees quarantine and get tested for coronavirus.

The two Texas attendees said they would be self-isolating and have been tested for coronavirus. Hermes told CNN she was only present for the outdoor speech, and would not quarantine or get tested, saying, ""I was nowhere near the man.""","['testing', 'took', 'positive', 'president', 'attendees', 'coronavirus', 'reception', 'photos', 'trump', 'hours', 'tested', 'cnn', 'fundraiser', 'roundtable', 'told', 'hermes', 'donors']"

Senior campaign adviser Jason Miller, when pressed by ABC's George Stephanopoulos about the rallies Trump has held in recent weeks where supporters are largely maskless and standing within six feet of one another in clear violations of federal health guidelines, said Sunday that Trump's team takes health guidelines meant to curb the spread of the deadly disease ""very seriously.""

""It's why we give everyone coming to rallies or events, we give them a mask. We check their temperature.

Trump, who has frequently mocked Biden's consistent use of a face mask, was hospitalized Friday afternoon , hours after he announced he had tested positive for Covid-19.

Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to Biden's campaign, stressed to CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday morning that the former vice president's campaign has adhered to guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since the onset of the pandemic earlier this year.

CNN on Friday obtained a new audio recording from Woodward's April 13 interview with Trump that sheds new light on the President's mindset. While Trump admitted to Woodward the virus is a ""plague"" that ""rips you apart,"" he has publicly resisted wearing a mask and has flouted social-distancing recommendations.

When Woodward pressed the President about whether he was worried about becoming infected, Trump dismissed concerns about his own health.

""You're risking getting it, of course,"" said Woodward. ""The way you move around and have those briefings and deal with people. Are you worried about that?""

""No, I'm not. I don't know why I'm not. I'm not,"" the President responded.

""Why?"" Woodward asked.

""I don't know,"" Trump said. ""I'm just not.""

The exchange, which is described in Woodward's recent best-selling book ""Rage,"" depicts a president with little concern that he himself could be at risk. Not quite six months later, Trump announced he has tested positive for the virus along with his wife, first lady Melania Trump.

Trump's apparent lack of concern for his own susceptibility to the virus adds more detail to a portrait of the President, whose health and well-being are of critical importance to the country's governance

This cavalier attitude about his health reflects his public posture of playing down the risk. He has contradicted or undermined the recommendations from experts in his own administration. And he has repeatedly said that the end of the virus' spread was just around the corner. The President's rosy assessment of the public-health crisis had not diminished even in the hours leading up to announcing his positive test results early Friday morning. In prerecorded remarks for Thursday night's Al Smith charity dinner, the President proclaimed that the ""end of the pandemic is in sight.""

But as Woodward's book and recorded conversations have demonstrated, Trump has admitted how deadly and contagious the disease is. During his April 13 interview with Woodward, Trump told the journalist that the virus is ""so easily transmissible, you wouldn't even believe it.""

CNN has previously reported that Trump told Woodward a story about a meeting of about 10 people in the Oval Office where someone in the room sneezed

""You know, just a sneeze, the entire room bailed out, OK? Including me, by the way,"" Trump said.

In other interviews with Woodward, Trump discussed the dangers of the coronavirus, saying as early as February 7 that the disease is ""deadly stuff."" Those admissions contradict his frequent public comments insisting that the virus is ""going to disappear"" and ""all work out fine.""

The recordings show that even in the early days of the pandemic, when relatively little was known about the virus, Trump recognized that he was part of a more vulnerable population. In an April 5 interview with Woodward, Trump explained that older people and those with ""a condition"" would be in ""big trouble"" if they contracted the disease.

""It moves rapidly, Bob. It moves rapidly and viciously. If you're the wrong person and if it gets you, your life is pretty much over if you're in the wrong group,"" Trump said.

""Well, that's our age group, isn't it sir?"" Woodward asked.

""It's -- well, hopefully we're much younger than that, Bob. You look younger. But, but it's our age group. You know? Older, especially 80. Well, you're not anywhere near that,"" Trump replied.

Woodward is 77 and Trump, at the time, was 73. He turned 74 in June.

As Woodward explains in his book, Trump said just days after declaring a national emergency that he liked downplaying the severity of the virus.

""I wanted to always play it down,"" Trump told Woodward on March 19. ""I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic.""","['catching', 'newly', 'covid', 'virus', 'president', 'youre', 'woodwards', 'im', 'wasnt', 'trump', 'worried', 'released', 'woodward', 'know', 'told', 'concerned']"

Early data from an ongoing study in the UK is setting off a wave of alarm over the pandemic this week. It found evidence that levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 took a sharp plunge in England’s general population during the summer, prompting fears that immunity to covid-19 may start to significantly wane in as little as three months.

Though the study’s findings are relevant, they’re not as scary as they appear. These kinds of studies alone can’t tell us if immunity fades away so quickly, and, importantly, antibodies are not the only factor that determines immunity to infectious diseases like covid-19. Other research, including a study just published today, suggests that our most important antibodies to covid-19 aren’t in as much peril as the UK study indicates.

Researchers at the Imperial College London, with the help of the government, have been conducting the Real Time Assessment of Community Transmission, or REACT, study in England since the start of the summer. One part of the project focuses on antibody levels to the coronavirus in the community, by asking people to use take-home tests that collect a finger prick blood sample. This week, on the preprint website medRxiv, the researchers released preliminary data from the study, involving more than 350,000 residents.

In late June, they found, about 6% of volunteers had detecta ble le vels of these antibodies. But in September, that number dropped to 4.4%.

“On the balance of evidence, I would say, with what we know for other coronaviruses, it would look as if immunity declines away at the same rate as antibodies decline away, and that this is an indication of waning immunity at the population level,” Wendy Barclay, head of the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College London, told reporters at a conference announcing the results this week.

Barclay is absolutely right to point out that our immunity to other coronaviruses does fade away over time. Experts have long said the same will probably happen with the coronavirus that causes covid-19, at some point. But beyond that, immunity to any one specific disease can be a tricky knot to untangle. And though these results may be solid, given the large sample size, the implications for our immunity to covid-19 aren’t so clear.

For one, it’s perfectly normal to see antibody levels to any recent germ drop over time. So seeing this decline over the past three months isn’t, by itself, proof that immunity will go away in that time period. The other consideration is that not all antibodies are the same. The most important are called neutralizing antibodies, because they can directly stop something like the coronavirus from infecting new cells. Even if our levels of antibodies to the coronavirus drop in the short term, most of us may still have enough neutralizing antibodies to stop reinfection for a while longer.

Just this afternoon, a new study seems to show that very thing happening. The study, published in Science, looked at antibody levels among 30,000 New Yorkers diagnosed with mild to moderate covid-19. After three months post-infection, the researchers continued to find a stable level of neutralizing antibodies in over 90% of their volunteers; in a subset of volunteers seen five months after their illness, the levels had only taken a small dip.

“Although this cannot provide conclusive evidence that these antibody responses protect from reinfection, we believe it is very likely that they will decrease the odds ratio of reinfection,” the authors wrote.

As experts have told Gizmodo previously, a person’s current antibody levels aren’t the only relevant factor to figuring out immunity. Our immune system also has memory B cells, which wake up the rest of the immune system when they detect a germ making a reappearance, including the ramping up of antibody production. This usually results in a much faster immune response the second time around. On top of that, there are certain T cells that “remember” a past germ and step into action when it tries to reinfect us. These other components may not prevent reinfection from the coronavirus entirely, but they should usually make the second infection much easier for the body to handle.

All of this is very complicated, and there’s a lot about our immune response to the coronavirus that we’re just now starting to understand (not to mention how these responses will affect a vaccine’s effectiveness). Unfortunately, there have been several reports of confirmed reinfection in multiple countries, including the U.S. In some but not most of these cases, the person got far sicker the second go-around, and at least one person has died from their reinfection. But many experts do not think that these reinfections are happening en masse right now, though the data needed to confirm how often it’s happening is still sorely missing.

The main takeaway here is that we should exercise caution in jumping to conclusions about any scary-sounding antibody studies. It’s still true that aiming for “herd immunity” is a ludicrous and dangerous idea, but moreso because it will lead to lots of preventable deaths and illness, not because we’ll get all reinfected in a few months.

Indeed, as I noted in June, the most present danger from covid-19 remains the first bout of infection. Despite the U.S. now being in the middle of its third large peak of the pandemic, the vast majority of Americans—and indeed people around the world—still haven’t caught covid-19 yet. Hopefully, most of us never will.","['study', 'coronavirus', 'antibody', 'covid19', 'immune', 'latest', 'antibodies', 'reinfection', 'away', 'dont', 'freak', 'levels', 'immunity']"

She had become dear to the I.C.U. team, said Ms. Gord, who stood quietly and with obvious emotion as the stretcher slipped past. “Bless her soul,” she murmured. “Sweet little lady.”

Staff members said they were fighting constant exhaustion. “What’s going to happen when we cannot take care of these patients?” said Dr. Pedro Salinas, a critical care specialist, who worries about how much longer the staff can endure. “They are emotionally and mentally exhausted.”

The prospect of ending up in an overcrowded hospital ward is making some who are sick with the virus hesitant to check in. At the hospital in El Paso, staff members said some Covid-19 patients were arriving in the emergency room so debilitated that they required intubation almost immediately.

Sandra Garcia, 31, an El Paso resident who tested positive for the coronavirus last week, said she had been grappling with fatigue, shortness of breath and a loss of taste and smell, but had refrained from seeking care in the city’s crowded hospitals.

In the meantime, she is caring for a 13-year-old who also has Covid-19 and 5-year-old twins, who are all studying online from home. Ms. Garcia said she questioned why Dee Margo, El Paso’s mayor, had failed to order a shutdown of the city to curb the spike in cases.

“He’s just trying to get re-elected and it’s disgusting,” Ms. Garcia said.

Last week, Mr. Margo announced new restrictions such as closing parks to league and tournament play, but he said an order for a full city shutdown would need to come from the governor of Texas.

Dr. German Hernandez, a nephrologist who has been caring for patients at several hospitals in El Paso, said the situation was so acute that patients on oxygen were being kept in rooms in the trauma area of University Medical Center. He said that could be devastating in the event of a disaster such as the August 2019 mass shooting at a Walmart in the city that left 23 people dead.

“God forbid we have another Aug. 3 shooting because we can’t handle it right now,” Dr. Hernandez said. “We have no buffer.”

Video of the shooting viewed by family members shows an assailant, who has not been arrested, confronting the baby-faced teenager before firing more than a dozen rounds.

But his football coach, Joe Bates, does not hesitate in assigning blame. With school entirely online and football season canceled, the coronavirus shattered the young man’s life, Mr. Bates said. The mandatory 7 a.m. study halls for the team’s players, the daily three-hour practices, the Friday games that last late into the night — all of that was gone this fall. In a normal year, Mr. Pryor would have been on the field, not on the streets, the coach said.

“It was Covid that really killed this kid,” he said.

Like many American cities, where economies have been ravaged by the pandemic, Oakland has seen a surge in gun violence, including six killings of juveniles since June and a 40 percent increase in homicides over all. To the south, in Los Angeles, the picture is equally bloody, with the city on pace to have more than 300 homicides for the first time since 2009.

Beyond California, major cities from Minneapolis to Milwaukee to New York, and even smaller communities like Lubbock, Texas, and Lexington, Ky., are all confronting the same grim pattern, with some places, like Kansas City, Mo., and Indianapolis, setting records for the number of killings in a single year. Philadelphia, which was gripped by unrest this week after the police shooting of a Black man, is among the cities with the highest increase in homicides — its 404 killings this year are a more than 40 percent increase compared with the same period last year.","['mr', 'covid', 'murders', 'shooting', 'pin', 'pryor', 'football', 'unusual', 'cities', 'rise', 'killed', 'killings', 'increase', 'suspect', 'oakland', 'homicides']"

Juganu, the venture-backed Israeli company that makes lighting systems capable of emitting light at specified wavelengths, is now selling a product that it claims can disinfect surfaces and deactivate pathogens in an attempt to provide buildings with new safety technologies that can prevent the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

The company claims that its J.Protect product was clinically validated through a study conducted by Dr. Meital Gal-Tanamy at the Bar-Ilan University Faculty of Medicine (although Dr. Gal-Tanamy’s research typically focuses on the Hepatitis C virus, which has a different transmission vector than airborne viruses like Sars-Cov-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19).

Juganu said that the new product has been registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 48 states and is currently working with Comcast, Qualcomm and NCR Corp. to bring its lighting disinfectant and deactivation technology to markets around the country.

The lighting technology uses two kinds of ultraviolet light — A and C — to render viruses inert and kill bacteria on surfaces, according to the company’s claims.

When people are present in a room, the company’s system uses UVA light which can render viruses inert after eight hours of exposure. If the room is empty, the lighting system will use UVC light, which is more potent as a disinfectant and more harmful to people, to disinfect a room in less than an hour.

The company tested its technology on surfaces, but did not conduct any tests involving their lighting system’s effects on aerosolized viral particles, which have been determined to be the main cause of infections from the novel coronavirus.

“We got an exemption from the FDA and are approved for distribution by the EPA in 48 states,” said Juganu chief executive, Eran Ben-Shmuel in an interview.

The company has already pre-sold the lighting technology in Israel and in India, according to Ben-Shmuel, and is now taking orders for installations in the U.S.

Juganu, which has raised $53 million to date from investors, including Comcast Ventures, Viola Growth, Amdocs and OurCrowd, has offices in Israel, Brazil, Mexico and the U.S., and has sold lighting systems to municipalities and businesses around the world.

The new hardware opens up a new line of business in the booming market for technologies targeting the reopening of businesses in the nations that have been hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Smart lighting will be one of the biggest areas of opportunity for physical spaces. We are evolving from lights simply illuminating spaces to disinfecting and securing them, as well as promoting well-being by recreating natural light shifts based on sunrise and sunset,” said Ben-Shmuel, in a statement.","['juganu', 'technology', 'surfaces', 'room', 'viruses', 'deactivation', 'begins', 'company', 'lighting', 'light', 'systems', 'system', 'techcrunch', 'product', 'selling', 'tunable', 'pathogen', 'disinfection']"

Should we gather indoors as usual, where we’ll most readily spread the virus? Gather outdoors in the cold, where we’re safer? Tell our families we won’t be seeing them this year except at a distance on FaceTime or Zoom?

“There is no easy answer,” says Aderonke Pederson, a psychiatrist and behavioral scientist at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “It’s a difficult situation to be in.”

It’s especially difficult considering that the US is now seeing a third massive spike in cases, that traveling brings its own risks of transmission, and that Covid-19 is a far deadlier disease among the elderly, who are a part of many family gatherings. The safest thing you can do is to just stay home. But because that may be a difficult choice for many families, WIRED asked the experts how to talk with your relatives about the risks of in-person gatherings.

First things first: Talk to your family about the holidays ASAP. “Start the conversations now, because we're a month away,” says Pederson. Find a way to speak comfortably about your concerns, she says, “because at the end of the day, while we're trying to protect ourselves, we're also trying to encourage our family members to protect themselves, too.”

To be very clear: There is no such thing as a perfectly safe way for families to gather, over the holidays or otherwise. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious virus, so no in-person interaction is risk-free. But there are gradients to this risk: Outdoors is better than indoors, masks worn at all times are better than bare faces, distance is better than hugs. And the fewer people, the better: California health officials suggest restricting holiday gatherings to three households for no more than a few hours, while Colorado has a two-household limit.

“The headline is that the things that you do to keep yourself safe in public from strangers apply to the family with whom you're gathering,” says Benjamin Singer, a critical care physician and pulmonologist at Northwestern Medicine. “Because for the purposes of transmission, your extended family that you're visiting are strangers. They're still people who aren't in your household.” That means the 6-foot social distancing rule you’ve been using at the grocery store also applies at your relatives’ house. Yes, that would be awkward, but necessary.

Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.

But what about testing in advance? It’s true that families can take some steps to mitigate risks in a way that you can’t with total strangers in public spaces. For example, you can all agree to get tested before gathering and only convene if everyone tests negative.

Yet that doesn’t eradicate the risk or mean that it’s safe to gather indoors, where the risk of transmission is normally highest. That’s because people can become infected between the day that they test and the day that their results arrive. Additionally, people in the early stages of a Covid-19 infection can test negative at first but still be infectious later, whether or not they ever show symptoms.

For example, say that you’re unwittingly exposed to the coronavirus on the Monday before Thanksgiving, and you get a test Tuesday that comes back negative. You arrive at your family’s house Wednesday and celebrate on Thursday. To your horror, on Friday you start showing symptoms of Covid-19. “It's probably somewhere around five to seven days after you're exposed where your test is going to be positive, and then you start having symptoms,” says Singer. So even a person with a negative test on Tuesday, he says, is “actually probably able to spread the virus at the table during Thanksgiving.”","['family', 'youre', 'covid19', 'holiday', 'better', 'virus', 'gatherings', 'test', 'transmission', 'way', 'gather', 'strangers', 'families']"

A study of more than 84,500 people backs prior indications that surviving the novel coronavirus may be associated with potentially serious cognitive deficits, Reuters reported on Tuesd ay. While the new study, which is based on an online survey, has some major limitations, other research has found that covid-19 can cause neurological issues even in people with mild cases.



Advertisement

The research team, led by Imperial College London’s Adam Hampshire, reviewed data from the Great British Intelligence Test—a collaborative project with BBC2 Horizon that collects a broad array of cognitive test and questionnaire data. It was expanded to include questions about covid-19 infection in May; in the dataset of about 84,500 people, 9,201 reported infections without respiratory symptoms; 3,466 had respiratory difficulties but did not obtain medical assistance; 176 required medical attention at home; 147 were hospitalized; and another 60 had to go on a ventilator.

“People who had recovered, including those no longer reporting symptoms, exhibited significant cognitive deficits when controlling for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group and pre-existing medical disorders,” the researchers wrote in the study. “They were of substantial effect size for people who had been hospitalised, but also for mild but biologically confirmed cases who reported no breathing difficulty.”

The GBIT is an online survey that has respondents answer a variety of questions about their life situation as well as complete tasks designed to measure their abilities in semantic problem solving, spatial working memory, selective attention, and emotional processing. Those results are in turn used to assess overall cognitive scores of a population. In this study, the researchers did not have before-and-after data for respondents who said they had been ill with the coronavirus. Instead, they calculated how many standard deviations their cognitive scores were from healthy controls, accounting for factors like age, gender, education, income, racial-ethnic group, and pre-existing medical conditions.

The researchers wrote that the survey results indicated the cognitive deficits were correlated with the degree of medical attention received, a proxy for the severity of each case. The h ardest hit were those who were hospitalized and required the user of a respirator, whose GBIT global composite scores were “equivalent to the average 10-year decline in global performance between the ages of 20 to 70 within this dataset” and larger than the mean deficit of those who had reported having a stroke or learning disability.

The “deficits were broad, affecting multiple cognitive domains,” the researchers added, though they were most apparent in “semantic problem solving and visual selective attention whilst sparing tests of simpler functions such as emotional processing and working-memory span.”

That said, there are some major caveats here. The study was not peer reviewed and relied on online questionnaires and tests, and experts told Reuters its design was inherently limited. In particular, the observed effects may not persist long-term.

Joanna Wardlaw, an applied neuroimaging professor at Edinburgh University, told Reuters: “The cognitive function of the participants was not known pre-COVID, and the results also do not reflect long-term recovery—so any effects on cognition may be short term.” University College London medical imaging science professor Derek Hill told the news agency the results did not contain before-and- after scores, and the vast majority of those who said they had fallen ill with coronavirus did not report testing positive for it, meaning many may have self-diagnosed . (However, testing positive for the virus was associated with worse outcomes in the GBIT, even among those with mild cases.) Hill said the study was an “intriguing but incon clusive piece of research into the effect of COVID on the brain,” adding that long-term research is needed to understand whether this brain damage is permanent.

This study adds to a body of knowledge suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause neurological damage. Some patients have reported loss of smell or taste (in rare cases perhaps permanently), and medical research published this year found evidence of neurological complications ranging from cognitive impairment or delirium to swelling and hemorrhaging in the brain in a small number of patients. Scientists suspect that cytokine storms, in which the body’s immune system attacks its own cells indiscriminately, may be one cause of damage to the neurological system and the heart.

Such observations wouldn’t be unprecedented. Medical researchers have observed surges of neuropsychiatric symptoms in past viral pandemics. In a study published earlier this year, University of California San Diego scientists argued that a potential wave of neurological illness caused by the pandemic will require long-term attentiveness by the medical community.

“We also want people to be aware that the nervous system could be involved in COVID-19, so we hope people will talk to their physicians about any emotional, behavioral, cognitive, or sensorimotor symptoms they might have over the course of their recovery,” lead author Emily Troyer, a UCSD psychiatrist, told Gizmodo at the time. “We don’t want to cause people more worry—we just want people to know to talk to their healthcare providers about these kinds of symptoms if they arise, and together we will get through this.”","['study', 'covid19', 'medical', 'function', 'researchers', 'reported', 'scores', 'cause', 'significant', 'patients', 'research', 'according', 'declines', 'neurological', 'survey', 'told', 'symptoms', 'cognitive']"

The new coronavirus was found in —” Yes, the American media hadn’t quite grasped the importance of that mysterious pneumonia yet. But countries like Thailand were already preparing full speed for a potential outbreak. This is where Dr. Supaporn comes in. She’s one of the top virus scientists in Thailand. And that very morning, she was testing a blood sample taken from a 61-year-old woman who’d just arrived in Bangkok from Wuhan with a fever. The sample had been sent to Dr. Supaporn’s lab with a question. Could this be the same virus that’s behind the mysterious illness in China? Because of her work with exotic viruses in bats, Dr. Supaporn had the expertise to do a sophisticated analysis on the sample from Wuhan. And wouldn’t you know — [ALARM] “Thailand has reported the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus found outside of China.” It’s hard to overstate just how big an achievement this was, identifying a pandemic-causing virus back when we were more concerned about Justin Bieber. Oh, by the way, the third most important story in the news that day? “Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg revealed that she is cancer-free.” That’s 2020 for ya. Thailand’s got 66 million people, and it’s right next door to China. Dr. Supaporn’s discovery gave them an invaluable head start in the fight against Covid, saving thousands of lives. And if you’re thinking, well, good for them, this accomplishment actually has America’s fingerprints all over it. “Hi.” It’s time you met Dennis Carroll. You might be wondering why the background is swaying a bit. “Well, we’re on my boat.” Yeah. It’s also his house. Pretty chill lifestyle. But for decades, he traveled around the world, helping countries control viral outbreaks. Eventually, Dennis realized it wasn’t enough to respond to an outbreak. But hey. What if we could predict one instead? So in 2009, he created a program called Predict. “It was really a project to really explore the limits of viral discovery, that is, go to the viruses before they come to us.” Armed with $200 million of your tax dollars, Dennis and his team spent the next decade training scientists to become virus hunters, including — Yup, Dr. Supaporn is a Predict alumnus. That’s where she learned the sophisticated test that identified the novel coronavirus. Thailand’s early breakthrough? We funded it. And Thailand isn’t the only place I found an American Covid success story. Picture the scene. It’s a morning in December, and we’re in a small room in Seoul. Twenty-five scientists are gathered around a table. This is Dr. Sang-won Lee, by the way. And he was one of the scientists leading this kind of role-playing game. Oh, OK, well, it’s more like a rehearsal, a rehearsal for a pandemic. They created an imaginary scenario. And you’ll never guess what it was. No kidding. These guys were actually workshopping Covid-19 weeks before anyone had ever heard of it. What South Korea learned from the game was they were totally unprepared for mass testing in the event of a coronavirus pandemic. So what did they do? Just to be clear, they were mass-producing coronavirus tests before the pandemic. And it paid off. “The response in South Korea has been so widely applauded.” “This is considered the gold standard.” Within a month of the first positive case, the government had tested more than 13,000 people. Fun fact: In the United States, we got our first positive case on the exact same day as Korea. But by February 20, our testing numbers were less than a fifth of theirs. So wait. What’s the American success story here? “Hello.” Let me introduce you to an American epidemiologist, a C.D.C. veteran, Dr. Sangwoo Tak. Back in 2014, he was part of a team of American scientists and military leaders who introduced their Korean counterparts to a really cool way to simulate potential disasters. “And that’s how they were able to start doing its own tabletop exercise.” That’s right. That life-saving role-playing game? That was an American idea. South Korea is a wealthy country with lots of experience with epidemics. But America helped them build a nationwide network of labs and inspired them to collaborate with private companies to develop all those early tests. They even renamed their own public health office the K.C.D.C. “The U.S. C.D.C. has been the leading public health institution in the world, bar none.” And South Korea isn’t the only C.D.C. fanboy. There are dozens of C.D.C.s all around the world. “This is the institution you would go to for guidance, for leadership.” America has been playing point on fighting emerging viral diseases around the world for 15 years. So what happened 15 years ago? “The Facebook.com.” “Are you a virgin?” “The winner, Carrie Underwood!” Well, yes, that, but also a highly infectious bird flu was spreading across the globe, killing tens of millions of chickens. I know, that seems quaint now. But at the time, it really spooked public health leaders, and also, this guy. “Pandemic is a lot like a forest fire. If caught early, it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder undetected, it can grow to an inferno that spreads quickly beyond our ability to control it.” “Avian influenza really was a watershed moment.” And the result of that is America authored all these super-detailed pandemic playbooks with specifics on exactly how to fight a virus. You know, really obscure techniques, like testing, contact tracing, social distancing. And to be clear, no one was saying “America first.” “The international scope of response and detection necessary to protect not only our own people, but people around the world.” “A threat that emerges anywhere in the world could pose a threat to everywhere in the world. No place was safe, and that became sort of a fundamental driver behind the U.S. strategy.” That’s why the U.S. sent money and experts all around the world to help other countries make their own pandemic plans, set up more sophisticated labs, and trained thousands of disease detectives. It was a Defense Department-funded lab in Egypt that confirmed some of the first cases of MERS in 2012. A year later, U.S. money and training were key in helping China stop a new strain of the bird flu. And U.S.-trained disease detectives have been on the front lines defeating Ebola in West Africa — “We’re going out to train contact tracers.” — polio in South Asia — “C.D.C. is the soul of this program.” — Zika in the Americas, and of course, many of these countries using our training, investments and playbooks, have crushed Covid this year. “The United States deserves an enormous amount of credit for having been able to work with and support countries around the world to better prepare for events like the Covid-19 virus.” I told you this was going to be a great American Covid success. “(CHANTING) U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A. U.S.A.” I have a lot of people in Korea coming to me and ask about how U.S. C.D.C. failed in this response. It’s embarrassing to see how the United States is experiencing what it’s experiencing now. But I don’t think U.S. C.D.C. failed. I think it’s U.S. government not supporting what U.S. C.D.C. could do. In the years that we ran simulations, we imagined every possible scenario of what type of virus, where it might emerge, how it might be transmitted, what would make it challenging to control — civil war, civil disruption. The one factor we never entered into those simulations as a variable was leadership. And it never occurred to any of us our political leadership would fail us so miserably. Today countries around the world are embodying the American spirit better than we are. They’ve built on top of our training and invested their own resources to beat the century’s greatest public health challenge. America has run pandemic simulations as recently as August 2019. Korea learned from theirs. We didn’t. In early January, coronavirus was in America too. Thailand was looking for it. We weren’t. If we want to defeat the coronavirus, we need to take our own advice. Follow the methods we invented and learn from the people we once inspired. “Coronavirus taught us why we need to work together with other countries.” “Countries have increasingly grown to mistrust U.S. leadership. It’s been erratic. It’s been selfish. It’s been America first. We’re going to have to re-establish that our leadership is with the intent of the global good, not just our own good, and that will not happen overnight.”","['helped', 'american', 'coronavirus', 'virus', 'america', 'countries', 'pandemic', 'korea', 'dr', 'defeat', 'york', 'world', 'times', 'scientists']"

To… [+1445 chars]","Good morning.

It’s been over a month since California moved from a county monitoring system to a new framework based on tiers. The new system assesses county metrics weekly and assigns color-coded tiers based on daily case numbers and positivity rates. Counties must stay in their respective tiers for three weeks before moving. They can move to a less restrictive tier once they have met that tier’s criteria for two weeks in a row. If their numbers worsen for two weeks, they will be moved to a more restricted tier.

The system also has equity measures built in. The pandemic has disproportionately affected communities with African-Americans, Latinos, and low-income and essential workers. Latinos account for nearly 50 percent of Covid-19 deaths despite making up 38 percent of the state’s population.

To combat this disparity, state health officials introduced a metric to help mitigate transmission rates in vulnerable communities. The new equity metric is applied to counties with populations greater than 106,000 and stipulates that for a county to move forward, it has to ensure that test positivity rates in its most disadvantaged neighborhoods do not significantly lag behind overall county test positivity rates.

Although there are concerns that additional measures would delay counties from advancing, Dr. Mark Ghaly, California’s health secretary, said in his briefing on Tuesday that so far, none of the counties have been held back because of the equity metric. In fact, Humboldt County moved into the least restrictive tier this week in part because of its focus on equity, he said.","['rates', 'update', 'positivity', 'county', 'tiers', 'counties', 'metric', 'california', 'equity', 'reopening', 'system', 'moved', 'weeks']"

The Tennessee Titans suspended all in-person activities Tuesday after three players and five members of the team’s personnel tested positive for the virus, the first such outbreak to hit a team since training camps began in late July. The Minnesota Vikings, who hosted the Titans on Sunday, had not received any positive results as of Tuesday morning, they said in a statement, but also shut down in-person activities.

“Both clubs are working closely with the N.F.L. and the N.F.L.P.A., including our infectious disease experts, to evaluate close contacts, perform additional testing and monitor developments,” the league said in a joint statement with the players’ union. “All decisions will be made with health and safety as our primary consideration. We will continue to share updates as more information becomes available.”

The Titans did not release the names of the players and personnel who tested positive, though Tuesday afternoon they placed three players — long snapper Beau Brinkley, defensive tackle DaQuan Jones and the practice-squad tight end Tommy Hudson — on the reserve/Covid-19-list. Separately, Coach Mike Vrabel said after Sunday’s game that the outside linebackers coach Shane Bowen did not travel with the team to Minnesota because of Covid-19 protocol, which calls for sidelining staff who either receive a positive test or are exposed to someone who has.","['covid19', 'positive', 'nfl', 'tested', 'titans', 'tests', 'team', 'minnesota', 'personnel', 'statement', 'outbreak', 'suspend', 'activities', 'players']"

Across the country, alarming signs suggested the worst was yet to come: The nation reported more cases on Thursday — more than 90,000 — than on any other single day. More than 20 states reported more cases over the past week than at any time during the pandemic. Patients were sent to field hospitals in El Paso and the Milwaukee suburbs. Growing outbreaks led to new restrictions on businesses in Chicago. Exactly zero states reported sustained declines in cases.

“There is no way to sugarcoat it — we are facing an urgent crisis and there is an imminent risk to you, your family members, your friends, your neighbors,” said Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin, where hospitals have been strained, case numbers have exploded and more than 200 coronavirus deaths have been announced in the past week.

With the presidential election days away, the country is now averaging more than 75,000 new cases daily, the worst stretch of the pandemic by that measure.

The 152 high school-aged boys from 21 states and territories and foreign countries, counselors and staff were asked to produce negative Covid-19 tests or proof they had been infected and recovered; to self-quarantine at home for a week before traveling to the camp; and to wear masks while traveling.

University Medical Center of El Paso's spokesman Ryan Mielke told CNN their hospital has 222 patients with Covid-19.

""We set a record yesterday and beat it today,"" Mielke said. ""It is just a new peak every day.""

About 978 patients with the virus are hospitalized in El Paso -- a city of 680,000 residents -- and 273 of those are in intensive care, according to the city's coronavirus dashboard.

The city is about to use its civic center for Covid-19 patients and will have 50 beds, Mielke said.

The hospital has already expanded its Covid-19 capacity by partnering with El Paso Children's Hospital, which has dedicated a floor to non-Covid-19 overflow patients, and it has a mobile isolation tent outside the hospital accepting patients.

A fourth mobile morgue is on its way to the hard-hit city, which has reported 605 deaths.

Asked about the surging cases and the link to the need for a fourth mobile morgue, Mielke said, ""Simple math will tell you a certain percentage of those will have negative outcomes.""

'We are breaking records all over the place'

No one wants another shutdown. But Americans who don't wear masks and ignore social distancing are fueling that possibility, doctors say.

""We are breaking records all over the place here. The rate of acceleration of this virus is just increasing,"" emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen said.

""We're already seeing our hospitals at breaking point in some parts of the country. And that means it doesn't just affect patients with coronavirus. It also means that elective surgeries are being put off for things like hip replacements, for cancer surgery or heart surgery in some cases,"" she said.

""When we get to breaking point here, we might have no other choice but to implement these measures that no one wants, like shutdowns. And that's why we all have to take action right now with targeted measures, like wearing masks, like restricting indoor gatherings -- things we can do now to prevent that really horrible outcome because cases are raging out of control across the US.""

Nationwide, the pandemic has gone from bad to worse.

The US just set a record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

And once again, increases in new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has gone up only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project.

Why this surge is so different from the others

""The difference between what's happening now versus what happened before is that the virus is everywhere now,"" Wen said.

""Before, there were just a few hotspots across the country. There were health care workers who could volunteer and go between different states,"" she said.

""But when the virus is so widespread, we could very well ... run out of health care workers, which means that patient care is going to suffer. And we will be at breaking point in our hospitals.""

Hospitalizations are the best measure of how the nation is faring against the pandemic. And surges in hospitalizations often lead to more deaths in the following weeks, said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.

Wen said she's particularly worried about rural hospitals, some of which are ""already unable to transfer patients to higher levels of care and may even be transferring their patients with heart attacks or strokes hundreds of miles away.""

The five states with the highest test positivity rates Monday are all in rural areas of the US -- South Dakota (50%), Wyoming (43%), Iowa (36%), Idaho (34%) and Kansas (34%).

But as of Monday, 36 states and Puerto Rico have exceeded that 5% threshold, according to Johns Hopkins.

All this comes after the highest-ever number of new cases reported anywhere in the world. On Friday, the US set the global record of new cases in one day -- 99,321.

The rapid acceleration has even stunned health experts.

""I was predicting just a week or two ago we'd hit 100,000 (new cases a day). I didn't imagine it would be already there,"" said William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor and chair of ACCESS Health International

""This pandemic is really rolling out of control, and we can change the trajectory. People know how to change it. Things as simple as universal mask wearing, social distancing, closing bars, stopping big rallies can make a big difference.""

He said the United States doesn't have to endure more shutdowns if everyone uses personal responsibility to put a lid on this pandemic.

""This is something we have to control and we can control, through our behavior,"" said Haseltine.

More than 9.2 million people across the US have tested positive for coronavirus, and more than 231,000 have died

Cases increase in nursing homes

New cases of Covid-19 are increasing in US nursing homes because of the growing spread in the general population, according to a report released Monday by the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living. More than 40% of the new cases are in the Midwest, the report says.

After seven weeks of declining cases in nursing homes through mid-September, cases started to rise as more states saw increasing levels of the virus, the organizations said.

""As we feared, the sheer volume of rising cases in communities across the U.S., combined with the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread of this virus, has unfortunately led to an increase in new COVID cases in nursing homes,"" Mark Parkinson, president and CEO of AHCA/NCAL, said in the news release.

The report also showed a slight rise in nursing home Covid-19-related deaths. Residents are typically older adults with multiple chronic conditions, meaning they are most vulnerable to severe disease and death from Covid-19.

Concerns about vaccine distribution

Health experts say a vaccine probably won't be widely available to the American public until mid-2021. But there are already some concerns about how vaccines will be distributed.

On Sunday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticized the Trump administration's vaccine distribution plan. He said the plan, as explained to him by the White House, involves the military distributing a future Covid-19 vaccine to large pharmacy chains.

""Why was the Covid infection rate so much higher in communities of Black and brown people? Because they're health-care deserts,"" the governor said.

The Department of Health and Human Services said in September that it will coordinate with the Department of Defense and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the delivery of vaccine supplies.

Cuomo called on the administration to conduct specific vaccine outreach in underserved communities, and to give states funding to develop their own such programs.

New York state was once the epicenter of Covid-19 in the US, but managed to drive its numbers down after drastic mitigation efforts

New York now has the third-lowest test positivity rate of any state in the country -- 1.7%, according to state officials.

""All I can do is warn New Yorkers and ask them to remember what worked for us: discipline and smarts. And we have to keep it up because these are dangerous times,"" the governor said.","['overflow', 'cases', 'mobile', 'covid19', 'states', 'paso', 'health', 'medical', 'according', 'vaccine', 'fourth', 'el', 'nursing', 'facility', 'virus', 'care', 'morgue', 'patients', 'civic', 'opens']"

In August Povetkin knocked Whyte out after twice being on the canvas himself

Dillian Whyte's rematch with Alexander Povetkin has been postponed after the Russian tested positive for coronavirus.

Povetkin, 41, produced a stunning knockout win over the British heavyweight in August and the pair were due to fight again on 21 November.

Promoter Eddie Hearn tweeted Povetkin was ""in hospital"".

""Povetkin-Whyte II is postponed with a new target date of 30 January 2021,"" Hearn's Matchroom Boxing tweeted. external-link

Matchroom said it would announce news on whether the rest of the 21 November show would go ahead in due course.

Whyte v Fury instead?

The news is a blow to 32-year-old Whyte, who has been preparing at his training camp in Portugal and worked remotely as a pundit for BBC Radio 5 Live during Oleksandr Usyk's win over Derek Chisora on Saturday.

Whyte knew a win over Povetkin would put him in with a clear shot at challenging for the WBC heavyweight title - held by Tyson Fury - in 2021.

Povetkin found a clinical punch to end their August contest after being on the canvas twice himself in the bout.

And Hearn was quick to raise the prospect of Whyte now being available to become Fury's opponent on 5 December.

Fury is due to fight in the UK on the date but so far has no opponent and Hearn posted on Twitter: ""Dillian Whyte v Tyson Fury anyone?""","['dillian', 'alexander', 'covid19', 'tweeted', 'hearn', 'tyson', 'fury', 'whyte', 'win', 'twice', 'postponed', 'v', 'povetkin', 'russian']"

One is that if your employer has the data for all the workers in your group, in the office and out, it can make better decisions. Having an overall picture of the rate of infection tells them something about patterns of employee behavior. If people pull out because they think they’re behaving well, that’ll skew the data. It could be best, given the concerns of data-driven management, if everyone complies.

My wife and I live in a beautiful community in the South Carolina Lowcountry that, unfortunately, uses the word “plantation” in its name. Knowing how offensive this word is, and the hurt it causes islanders of color (e.g., the Gullah Geechee people), we joined a group of residents formed to convince the governing board to replace the word “plantation” in the community’s name with something else. Ultimately, our efforts were unsuccessful. More than 52 percent of respondents voted to keep the name as is.

Before this issue arose (and before we were fully aware of the offensiveness of “plantation”), we were considering moving to a new home in our community; now we are not so sure we should. Given what we now know, is it ethical to buy a home in a community that affirmatively chooses to keep an offensive name? Name Withheld

I’m with you on changing the name. Plantations were places where Black people were not only denied basic human rights but were also subject to sexual assault and physical torture — a repugnant legacy to want to hold onto. But you’ve done your part to try to put this right. And if you stick around, you can try to make the change again. Leaving is giving up on that project — and on the 48 percent who agree with you. You say the area is beautiful: If you’re happy there, moving away would be a loss and inconvenience to you, for no obvious gain. The times are changing. We can hope your side will prevail sometime soon.

Some years ago, I was raped by an acquaintance. Before that event, I was warned by friends to keep my distance from him but didn’t heed their advice; I later learned that this man violently sexually assaulted another woman before he assaulted me. I went to the police following my experience, but he was never charged with any crime and he moved away soon after. I eventually moved, too.

Recently, I moved to yet another city and learned that he moved to the city where I had been living last, and where I still have many friends and acquaintances, particularly in the L.G.B.T. community. I know that he identifies as L.G.B.T.

To my knowledge, he has not assaulted anyone since I reported him to the police. He quit drinking and got married. He lost many friends and raised money for a domestic-violence organization. I developed PTSD as a result of the attack and have spent years in therapy to diminish (but not completely eliminate) my symptoms, and this led to the dissolution of my marriage at the time. I have since rebuilt a new life with a new partner and built a career that allows me to work in mental health. Is it my responsibility to warn my friends in his new city, or is it my ethical obligation to let him continue to lead his life? Name Withheld

I am so sorry to hear about what this person did to you. It’s natural, given that he never faced punishment for his crime, to want to see him pay some penalty. And you could do that by letting people in the community where he lives know about your experience. But you didn’t ask me whether you should seek to make him pay for his crime; you asked if you had a duty to tell people in the community where he now lives what he has done. You report evidence that he’s reformed — he has given up alcohol (which is especially relevant if his drinking played a role in the attack), married, committed to public service and, perhaps, paid some cost for his behavior in lost friends. So you don’t seem to think he poses a clear ongoing threat. You have no duty, then, to revisit this trauma for the sake of the safety of those in his community, particularly if doing so would risk psychological harm to you.","['plantation', 'testing', 'covid', 'crime', 'free', 'community', 'dont', 'word', 'need', 'assaulted', 'given', 'really', 'know', 'accept', 'city', 'moved', 'friends']"

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday updated its covid-19 guidance to say that the coronavirus can spread through aerosols, not just large droplets. This is an important distinction because it means that maintaining 6 feet of distance indoors is not always enough to prevent transmission. Virus-containing aerosols can linger in the air and spread throughout a room, especially poorly ventilated spaces where people are talking or singing, which is why wearing masks is so crucial.

Previously, CDC guidance did not include warnings about so-called airborne transmission, which involves tiny aerosols emitted by an infected person that can float and travel throughout a space (as opposed to transmission via larger droplets that don’t travel far before falling to the ground). Today, the CDC’s official guidance page says: “COVID-19 can sometimes be spread by airborne transmission. Some infections can be spread by exposure to viruses in small droplets and particles that can linger in the air for minutes to hours. These viruses may be able to infect people who are further than 6 feet away from the person who is infected or after that person has left the space.”

Last month, the CDC briefly altered its guidance page to note the risk of aerosol transmission, but it later removed that update. CDC officials said the language had been added by mistake and had not yet undergone scientific review.

Gizmodo reporter Ed Cara has written about the difficulty in classifying viruses as airborne versus not. Unfortunately, the science is complex, and the same virus can sometimes be airborne and sometimes not, depending on the circumstances. For example, an air conditioning unit can spread exhalations from an infected person far across a room, as happened in a Korean Starbucks where 27 people were infected at once.

Some viruses, like measles, are most definitely airborne, which is part of why they are so contagious. Others, like influenza, seem to be mostly droplet-spread but sometimes airborne. The virus behind covid-19, known as SARS-CoV-2, appears to be somewhere in the middle. Regardless of exactly how airborne it is, though, people should take the necessary precautions: wearing masks around others and avoiding crowded indoor spaces. Airborne transmission is much less of a risk outdoors, since aerosols emitted by an infected person are quickly dispersed by the large volume of air. Improving indoor ventilation is likely to help reduce the risk of transmission, as Atlantic writer Zeynep Tufecki has reported. Washing hands and avoiding touching your face continues to be wise, but as the CDC’s guidance page notes, “Spread from touching surfaces is not thought to be a common way that COVID-19 spreads.”

As the U.S. heads into winter and the holiday season, the temptation to spend time indoors with friends and family is going to be high for many of us. But given what we know about how the virus spreads, the best place to see other people continues to be outdoors. If you’re indoors with people outside your household or social bubble, wear masks and keep the windows open, because 6 feet of distance and hand sanitizer are not enough to stay safe.

Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has put the kibosh on any dreams of rushing out its experimental covid-19 vaccine before the U.S. election day. The good news is that the company is optimistic that its vaccine will be ready to apply for the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization (EUA) by the end of November, raising hopes that it could see use in the U.S. before the end of 2020.

Pfizer is developing its vaccine in collaboration with the German firm BioNTech, and the companies had previously set a EUA submission target of mid-October. In an open letter published on Friday, Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla outlined what steps need to be taken and shifted the estimate for a review in an effort to “clear up a great deal of confusion.”

Bourla explained that the vaccine has to go through three steps in development before FDA approval can begin. The first step is making sure it’s effective in preventing covid-19 infection in most patients. Pfizer believes that data should be in by the end of October. That process involves a review of the blinded data by an independent committee of scientists. The committee’s conclusions will be shared with the public shortly after they’re submitted to Pfizer.

Next, Pfizer has to prove the vaccine is safe and that the manufacturing process can guarantee the consistency and quality of the vaccine. The company said it expects to have the proper data for the manufacturing process in the coming weeks and that the safety trials should be complete by the third week of November.

Bourla’s repeated emphasis on providing “greater clarity” and reducing confusion appears to be related to political noise that has come from the White House in recent months. President Trump has repeatedly given false assurances that a vaccine would be ready before the November 3 election—causing anxiety that the White House could try to rush an unsafe vaccine to market to win points with voters. Facing the risk of losing public confidence in the efficacy of covid-19 vaccines, the FDA issued stricter guidelines for emergency approval reviews, requiring more safety data. The White House blocked those guidelines then quickly unblocked them. So, yeah, you could say there’s been some confusion.

“We are operating at the speed of science,” Bourla said.

At the moment, Pfizer has its eyes on approval in the U.S., but BioNTech plans to seek emergency approvals in Europe shortly after the FDA review, according to the Wall Street Journal. The companies expect to produce 100 million doses by the end of the year—enough to provide the two necessary shots for 50 million people.","['emergency', 'coronavirus', 'house', 'white', 'data', 'end', 'pfizer', 'vaccine', 'review', 'process', 'ready', 'fda']"

He dismissed it as insignificant.

“If someone doesn’t want to do a test, one or two people maybe, it doesn’t mean that the whole village wants to do it,” Mr. Brach said.

Dr. Gelman said her contact tracers were sometimes stymied in their efforts in the community. For example, in several recent cases, school administrators at ultra-Orthodox schools in Kiryas Joel that remained open despite the lockdown order, did not respond to contact tracers’ calls after children at school tested positive.

“Clearly these are not isolated incidents, where there are one or two or three individuals that presented over the course of a month or two that all of a sudden declined testing,” Dr. Gelman said. “This is a lot more widespread.”

Drastic drops in the positivity like the one in Orange County are highly unusual, said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. She said the situation may reflect a lesson epidemiologists have learned from countless previous outbreaks and pandemics.

“If public health measures are seen as punitive,” she said, “you will drive cases underground.”

In the Brooklyn “red zone,” the rates have also dropped, but far more gradually: In the last week of September, the test positivity rate in the Brooklyn area with the highest level of restriction was 7.7 percent. On Oct. 29, the rolling average in the area was about 4 percent, a state official said.

Last week, New York City health officials said that they had also heard similar concerning reports of test refusal in the city’s red zones.","['virus', 'dr', '34', 'positivity', 'area', 'tracers', 'gelman', 'test', 'tested', 'school', 'change', 'red', 'week', 'health', 'fell', 'rate']"

David Andahl, a Republican candidate for the North Dakota state legislature, won election on Tuesday, but the 55 year old won’t be taking office. Unfortunately, Andahl died of the coronavirus last month.



Andahl, who was known as a “Trump Republican,” died of covid on October 5, according a report last month in the Bismarc k Tribune. Mail-in voting started on September 24, which meant that ballots in the central North Dakota district couldn’t be changed under state law.

Andahl won District 8 in the state legislature along with another Republican, Dave Nehring. Voters chose between four candidates, two Republicans and two Democrats, and were able to vote for any two people. It seems most people in North Dakota’s District 8 decided they’d rather vote for a dead guy than for a Democrat.

The vote breakdown, according to the North Dakota Secretary of State, with the two top candidates getting District 8's two seats:

Dave Nehring (Republican) - 6,763 votes - 40.72%

Dave Andahl (Republican) - 5,901 votes - 35.53%

Kathrin Volochenko (Democrat) - 1,896 votes- 11.42%

Linda Babb (Democrat) - 1,641 votes - 9.88%

Write-in - 408 votes - 2.46%

North Dakota has seen a dramatic surge in coronavirus cases over the past month, with a troubling rise in cases of 49% over the past two weeks. North Dakota reported 1,172 new cases and 16 new deaths on Tuesday alone, staggering numbers for a state of just 750,000 people. In total, North Dakota has identified at least 47,192 cases and 561 deaths since the pandemic began earlier this year.

White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Deborah Birx noted on a recent trip to North Dakota that the state was not following public health guidelines to protect people during the pandemic.

“Over the last 24 hours as we were here, and we were in your grocery stores, and in your restaurants and frankly even in your hotels, this is the least use of masks that we have seen in retail establishments of any place we have been,” Birx said during a roundtable in Bismarc k on October 27.

It’s not clear what will happen to Andahl’s state legislative seat, since most precedent in this area date back decades. Some reports claim the Republican Party of North Dakota will get to pick Andahl’s replacement, but one local newspaper says it’s possible the losers in the race could sue to obtain the seat. All possibilities seem like they’re on the table at the moment.

Andahl previously served for 16 years on the Burleigh County Planning and Zoning Commission and received the endorsement of top Republicans in the state, including Governor Doug Burgum.

“I am as conservative as they come, and I tell it like it is,” Andahl wrote in a Facebook post on May 27.

Andahl was only sick for just four days before he was hospitalized and succumbed to the disease according to his mother, who spoke with the Bismarc k Tribune. Andahl’s mom told the newspaper that she had no idea how her son had become infected.

The North Dakotan was a cattle rancher and race car driver who even gave lessons and put on car and motorcycle shows. Andahl had no spouse and no children, though his dog Hank “was the love of his life,” according to the Tribune.

It was these voters at the center whom Mr. Biden had most aggressively targeted, using a message of unity and American tradition to offer voters a respite from the bombast of the current president, and to push back against the Trump campaign’s portrayal of the Democrat as a tool of the left.

For the first time, not one but two probability-based, scientifically sound voter surveys were conducted amid the election. The Edison exit polls, conducted on behalf of a consortium of news organizations, were carried out by phone with voters who had cast ballots early, and by in-person interviews at voting places.

The Associated Press also conducted its own voter survey, called VoteCast, using a panel of online respondents assembled by NORC, a research group based at the University of Chicago.

The overall trends in the results were consistent between the two organizations’ surveys, though the exit polls appeared to show Mr. Trump running strongly in more states than the VoteCast survey did. The two polls also asked different questions of their respondents; results from both are referred to in this article.

In contrast to four years ago, a very small share of voters, in the single digits, said they had decided within the past few days, according to the exit polls. Four years ago, 13 percent said they had decided in the final week, according to exit polls.

Pre-election polls throughout this election season had shown that roughly four in five voters held strong opinions on Mr. Trump and his leadership, and strong feelings on both sides continued to define this year’s election.","['vote', 'mr', 'using', 'came', 'polls', 'pandemic', 'votecast', 'trump', 'voters', 'economy', 'election', 'conducted', 'showed', 'versus', 'voter', 'exit']"

When it comes to transmission of Covid-19 through day cares, data remains scarce.

Nevertheless, studies from several countries have found that, once they are exposed, kids under 10 are about half as likely to be infected as older children and adults, said Justin Lessler, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

And when they do get infected, they seem to be less likely to develop severe symptoms and die.

However, the risk isn’t zero. More than 740,000 children (some states define a child as anyone up to age 20) have been infected since states started reporting case numbers. And cases have been rising steadily in children since the beginning of the pandemic.

“Every form of social interaction poses a risk in the pandemic,” said Dr. Lessler, who is currently sending his 1-year-old to day care, “and day cares are no different.”

So, beyond my kids, what are the risks for me and my family?

Scientists still don’t know how often kids pick up the virus at day care and then spread it to the people they live with, Dr. Lessler said. But some early evidence suggests that while sending your kids is not risk-free, it might not be as high risk to your family as you may fear.

Over the summer, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Rhode Island health and human services departments examined how many people — including children, staff, parents or guardians — became ill after 666 child care facilities in Rhode Island reopened.

Between June 1 and July 30, they found that only 52 people from 29 child care centers had either confirmed or probable Covid-19. Nearly 19,000 children had attended those facilities, and most of the people infected did not spread the virus to others (likely in part because of class closures, quarantines and contact tracing). Seventy five percent of the cases also occurred in mid- to late July, as numbers were spiking across the state.

This suggests that it’s possible for day cares to operate safely, said Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University, who has been collecting informal data on cases and outbreaks in day cares and schools since the pandemic began.

The U.S. has broken its own record for daily cases of covid-19, with 116,225 new cases on Thursday, according to the Covid Tracking Project, up from the previous record of 103,087 new cases on Wednesday. The country also identified 1,124 new deaths from coronavirus on Thursday, bringing the total to 234,937 deaths based on figures maintained by Johns Hopkins University. And public health experts warn it’s going to get much worse in the coming days and weeks.

The Upper Midwest states are being hit the hardest by covid-19 right now, relative to population. North Dakota recorded over 2,000 cases per million people on Thursday, the highest number ever for any state. The state has been reluctant to adopt mask ordinances that would slow the spread of the disease, while even members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force have noted that mask use is low and likely contributing to the problem.

Other states in the Midwest are struggling with high test positivity rates, with Minnesota setting a new state record of 9.2%, a largely uncontrolled pandemic. Health workers in states like Minnesota are also getting sick at higher rates, according to a new report from NBC-TV affiliate KTTC in Rochester, the home of the Mayo Clinic.

Hospitalizations for covid-19 are rising in the U.S. and many regions are seeing their health care resources stretched thin. And even people outside of public health are taking notice. CNBC, a cable news outlet that skews heavily right wing, has shifted dramatically this morning with experts speaking about the drag that the worsening pandemic might have on the economy and the financial markets. CNBC had one expert on who warned that hospitals could face unprecedented pressure from covid-19 in early 2021.

Former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a regular on CNBC, advised the Trump regime to work harder on combatting the pandemic between now and January, something that seems extremely unlikely.

While Americans are glued to their TVs and social media feeds, watching presidential election returns coming in from places like Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Georgia on Friday morning, the country still has a pandemic that’s sickening over 100,000 people per day. The mortality rate for the disease has decreased since the spring, but as we now know, even if you survive the coronavirus, there are potentially long term health consequences.

After the pandemic spread to the West, internet platforms were flooded with local ads for PPE of unknown and/or dubious quality and other dubious coronavirus offers — even after some of the firms banned such advertising.

The concern here is not only consumers being ripped off but the real risk of harm if people buy a product that does not offer the protection claimed against exposure to the virus or even get sold a bogus coronavirus “cure” when none in fact exists.

In a statement today, Didier Reynders, the EU commissioner for justice, said: “We know from our earlier experience that fraudsters see this pandemic as an opportunity to trick European consumers. We also know that working with the major online platforms is vital to protect consumers from their illegal practices. Today I encouraged the platforms to join forces and engage in a peer-to-peer exchange to further strengthen their response. We need to be even more agile during the second wave currently hitting Europe.”

The Commission said Reynders met with 11 online platforms today — including Amazon, Alibaba/AliExpress, eBay, Facebook, Google, Microsoft/Bing, Rakuten and (TechCrunch’s parent entity) Verizon Media/Yahoo — to discuss new trends and business practices linked to the pandemic and push the tech companies to do more to head off a new wave of COVID-19 scams.

In March this year EU Member States’ consumer protection authorities adopted a common position on the issue. The Commission and a pan-EU network of consumer protection enforcers has been in regular contact with the 11 platforms since then to push for a coordinated response to the threat posed by coronavirus scams.

The Commission claims the action has resulted in the platforms reporting the removal of “hundreds of millions” of illegal offers and ads. It also says they have confirmed what it describes as “a steady decline” in new coronavirus-related listings, without offering more detailed data.

In Europe, tighter regulations over what e-commerce platforms sell are coming down the pipe.

Next month regional lawmakers are set to unveil a package of legislation that will propose updates to existing e-commerce rules and aim to increase their legal responsibilities, including around illegal content and dangerous products.

In a speech last week, Commission EVP Margrethe Vestager, who heads up the bloc’s digital policy, said the Digital Services Act (DSA) will require platforms to take more responsibility for dealing with illegal content and dangerous products, including by standardizing processes for reporting illegal content and dealing with reports and complaints related to content.

A second legislative package that’s also due next month — the Digital Markets Act — will introduce additional rules for a sub-set of platforms considered to hold a dominant market position. This could include requirements that they make data available to rivals, with the aim of fostering competition in digital markets.

MEPs have also pushed for a “know your business customer” principle to be included in the DSA.

Simultaneously, the Commission has been pressing for social media platforms to open up about what it described in June as a coronavirus “infodemic” — in a bid to crack down on COVID-19-related disinformation.

Today the Commission gave an update on actions taken in the month of September by Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and TikTok to combat coronavirus disinformation — publishing its third set of monitoring reports. Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market, said more needs to be done there too.

“Viral spreading of disinformation related to the pandemic puts our citizens’ health and safety at risk. We need even stronger collaboration with online platforms in the coming weeks to fight disinformation effectively,” he said in a statement.

The platforms are signatories of the EU’s (non-legally binding) Code of Practice on disinformation.

Legally binding transparency rules for platforms on tackling content such as illegal hate speech look set to be part of the DSA package. Though it remains to be seen how the fuzzier issue of “harmful content” (such as disinformation attached to a public health crisis) will be tackled.

A European Democracy Action Plan to address the disinformation issue is also slated before the end of the year.

In a pointed remark accompanying the Commission’s latest monitoring reports today, Vera Jourová, VP for values and transparency, said: “Platforms must step up their efforts to become more transparent and accountable. We need a better framework to help them do the right thing.”","['scams', 'disinformation', 'coronavirus', 'digital', 'content', 'ecommerce', 'today', 'pandemic', 'data', 'share', 'platforms', 'commission', 'techcrunch', 'fight', 'consumers', 'urges', 'europe', 'illegal']"

The U.S. recorded over 100,000 new cases of covid-19 on Wednesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project. The shockingly high daily case count is a grim milestone that public health experts warn may be surpassed in the coming days and weeks.

The country tallied 103,087 new cases of coronavirus and 1,116 deaths from the disease on Wednesday , with hospitalizations continuing to rise steadily by the day. There are currently 52,049 Americans hospitalized with covid-19 as of Wednesday night, according to the latest figures compiled by the Covid Tracking Project.

The pandemic is hitting the Midwest particularly hard right now, with many hospitals at the brink of capacity. Wisconsin’s ICU beds are currently over 88% occupied, according to the state’s covid-19 website. Hospitals in the Twin Cities of Minnesota are at 98% capacity.

South Dakota currently has the highest hospitalization rate in the country, relative to population, with 526 people per million in the state hospitalized with covid-19. North Dakota is close behind with 462 people per million hospitalized, while Montana has 381 covid-19 patients hospitalized per million.

Thirty-four of the nation’s 50 states reported over 1,000 new cases on Wednesday, another record. Wisconsin reported over 6,000 new cases, Illinois reported over 7,000 new cases and Minnesota reported over 3,000 new cases.

The U.S. has identified over 9.4 million covid-19 cases since the pandemic began earlier this year, and at least 233,000 deaths for coronavirus , the highest in the world. Both numbers are believed to be an undercount since many cases are asymptomatic and people often have no idea they’ve been infected.

The coronavirus pandemic is also ravaging other countries in Europe, including the UK, Spain, France, and Germany. But several countries are instituting new lockdown measures in an attempt to break the cycle of infection and ensure that their hospital systems aren’t overwhelmed.

The new lockdowns, like the one in the UK, are controversial, as so-called covid-fatigue sets in. B ut masks are crucial to public health, especially when universal masking is not an option. Brit ai n, like the U.S., has seen resistance by the general public from people who don’t want to wear masks. England is even imposing fines for people who won’t wear masks, but there are still a lot of people who refuse to take the most basic public health precautions seriously during a pandemic.

But many other countries have been able to get their coronavirus figures down to manageable numbers, with China, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand all doing better than much of the rest of the world. Australia, for instance, saw a bad second wave of the virus start in July, but went into lockdown and currently has no community transmission of the disease.



It’s going to be a long winter in the U.S., no matter who wins the election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump . The votes are still being counted in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania and Arizona, but even if Biden wins, he doesn’t take office until January 20. In the meantime, Americans have to fend for themselves as President Trump continues to endanger the country by not acting to protect people from covid-19.

Forced in the spring to close their doors, most K-12 schools and universities shifted to online learning where teachers lead classes virtually and students submit their assignments electronically.

According to the World Economic Forum, it is estimated that 1.2 billion students around the world this year were “out of the classroom” due to the pandemic, while in the United States, over 55 million K-12 students didn’t receive in-person instruction.

The use of telemedicine and video conferencing also has become a principal platform for medical consultations as a result of the coronavirus. For example, a Forrester analysis projected “general medical care visits to top 200 million this year, up sharply from their original expectation of 36 million visits for all of 2020.” Virtual connections allow patients to get recommendations wherever they are and draw on a broad range of medical expertise.

E-commerce is taking off as consumers abandon small retail outlets and large department stores. An industry study found that “total online spending in May 2020 reached $82.5 billion, up 77% from May of 2019” and those numbers almost surely will increase in coming months as people appreciate the convenience of online ordering and home delivery.

Yet the pandemic also has exposed dramatic inequities in technology access and utilization. Not everyone has the high-speed broadband required for online education, telemedicine and online shopping. The Federal Communications Commission has estimated it would take $40 billion to close the bulk of the broadband gap. But many people also lack laptops, notebooks, smartphones or electronic devices that allow them to stream videos and take advantage of new modes of service delivery.

It is not just that some are outside the online world, but that digital access is spread inequitably across various groups. According to an Education Week survey, 64% of American teachers and administrators in schools with a large number of low-income students said their pupils faced technology limitations, compared to only 21% of students in schools with a small number of low-income students. The problem isn’t simply broadband, but access to equipment and devices that allow pupils to make use of online resources.

There are substantial racial disparities as well. A McKinsey analysis found that 40% of African-American students and 30% of Hispanic students in U.S. K-12 schools received no online instruction during COVID-induced school shutdowns, compared to 10% of whites. These gaps in access to online education and digital services widen the already substantial educational inequalities that exist, but push them to new heights. If continued for a lengthy period of time, such differentials expose our most disadvantaged students to large barriers to advancement and a future of income deprivation or economic stagnation. Even more tragic, there may be a tipping point beyond which the gap is no longer recoverable.

These types of inequities are intolerable injustices that create nearly insoluble gaps with serious social and economic consequences. The variations noted above increase income inequality, widen the opportunity gap between social groups and doom those left behind to low-paying jobs, temporary positions without health benefits or outright unemployment. Not having access to the digital superhighway limits opportunities for online education, telemedicine and e-commerce and makes it nearly impossible to apply for jobs, request government benefits or access needed health or educational materials.

What is required right now is investment in digital infrastructure and improvements in digital access that eliminate unfair disparities based on race, income and geography. For example, the Federal Communications Commission needs to expand its current “Lifeline” program designed to promote phone connectivity for poor people to the internet. Many providers combine phone and internet usage so there is no reason to provide subsidies for phone service without also including internet service. With the availability of Voice over Internet Protocols (VoIP), it is easy for underserved people to combine phone and internet connectivity.

This FCC also should expand its “Schools and Libraries” program called “E-rate” to include home schooling and remote learning. With so many educational institutions closed and providing instruction through online education, the commission should use the millions in unexpended program funds to close the “homework gap” created by the COVID-19 pandemic. That would help impoverished students access online resources and video conferencing facilities.

The Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service seeks to improve broadband service in rural areas but its funding currently cannot be used to improve low-speed broadband. At a time when many lack sufficient speed to access online educational resources, telemedicine or video streaming, that limitation makes little sense and needs to be altered so that rural-dwellers can upgrade their internet service.

In the education sphere, states and localities must ensure that racial and income-based disparities in access to online learning are not a permanent feature of the K-12 landscape. Addressing this issue is going to require much more than distributing free laptops to needy students, as is often advocated. Rather, it will involve making sure families can afford the broadband access that will enable pupils to use the laptops in productive ways, teachers are well-trained in distance learning and educational programs equip young people with the skills needed in the 21st century economy.

As we move into the future, broadband will be as vital to social and economic advancement as highways, bridges and dams were in earlier eras. Similar to the 20th century, improving access requires national planning and public and private sector investments. Indeed, digital access should be considered a human right in the same manner as access to universal healthcare. People cannot participate in the digital economy and online learning systems without high-speed broadband.

As noted in our recent AI book, the United States requires a national plan that funds digital infrastructure, reduces racial and geographic disparities, facilitates universal medical insurance and prepares workers for the digital economy. The list of national imperatives includes closing the digital divide, expanding anti-bias rules for the digital economy, building an inclusive economy through more equitable tax policies and training the next generation of workers.

New digital services or financial transactions taxes could help fund the programs that need to be undertaken to deal with these issues. One hundred years ago, as the United States underwent industrialization, national leaders adopted an income tax to pay for needed services, and as we move into a digital economy, there will need to be new types of taxes to pay for needed expenditures. We cannot allow current inequities in access to education and healthcare to deny opportunities to African-Americans, Hispanics, immigrants and poor people. Leaving those individuals behind as the digital economy grows is not a viable option if we’re ever as a nation to achieve our full potential by empowering all Americans.

Data is the key to many emerging technologies so it is crucial to have unbiased information to develop new services, evaluate digital innovation and deal with the ramifications of current products. Much of the current digital data is proprietary in nature and therefore limits the ability of researchers to improve innovation, close the digital divide and develop remedies that address equity problems. The federal government sits on a trove of data that should be made available for commercial and research purposes on an anonymized basis so that privacy is maintained. In the same way that census data enables research, economic development and program assessment, wider access to digital data likely would spur new products and services while also helping to address equity problems.

In a country that continues to be plagued by the coronavirus, it is vital to reduce the inequities that deny opportunity to large groups of Americans and make it impossible for them to share in the benefits of the digital revolution. As we envision a post-COVID world, it is essential we build an inclusive economy that allows everyone to participate in and gain the benefits of the online world.

The fundamental shifts wrought by COVID are not going to slow even after a vaccine is developed and the effects of the coronavirus dissipate over time. Nearly all of the technological trends generated by COVID this year will remain a large part of our ongoing landscape. Due to advances in computer storage and processing power, 5G networks and the growing use of data analytics, technology innovation almost certainly will accelerate in coming years.

Having a substantial part of our fellow citizens outside the digital environment is a recipe for continued racial injustice, social conflict, economic deprivation and political division. It will ensure that cynicism, discontent and anger will remain a feature of the American social landscape for decades to come. The last four years have exposed the massive inequities in American society, made worse not only by the intentional political polarization of the American public, but also by a digital divide that is virtually certain to lock in many pernicious dimensions of inequality in America.

This is not a technology problem, it’s a leadership challenge. Leadership can solve this national crisis by demonstrating the will to wield technology in the best interests of all Americans. The next administration has it within its capacity to address these matters head on and eliminate this divide, or conversely, if it doesn’t take appropriate action, condemn our most vulnerable citizens to four more years of neglect and inequity.","['education', 'technology', 'access', 'covid19', 'digital', 'pandemic', 'economic', 'address', 'internet', 'students', 'broadband', 'economy', 'techcrunch', 'online', 'exposed', 'inequality']"

Siegel studies indoor air quality, and he and his colleagues were testing the air in the store—he wouldn’t say which one. This is the possibly grim future part: While they were up there, they found that one of the six HVAC units (that’s heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) was installed exactly upside down. Like, 180 degrees from spec. “The door that was used to access the filter couldn’t be fully opened, and the filter couldn’t be replaced,” Siegel says.

When the team went back six months later to test again, “the filter was entirely plugged with dust and other stuff. There was literally no way to change it without a Sawzall to cut the frame,” Siegel says. At the time, Siegel knew what that meant. The air inside the store would be that much crummier. It was, in a way, just like a thousand other HVAC mistakes Siegel has seen: dampers that are supposed to admit outside air into a building rusted open or shut, badly installed filters letting air pass around their edges, forced-air fans running barely 18 percent of the time. In theory, HVAC heats and air-conditions. In practice, it doesn’t always ventilate or filter.

But now that scientists around the world largely agree that the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2—like a lot of other respiratory viruses—transmits most easily indoors, in crowded and poorly ventilated spaces, that occasional, multipronged failure signifies a much more serious problem. As the number of people infected with Covid-19 in the US breaks records, and cooped-up kids and suffering business owners agitate for a life slightly more normal, the once boring ventilation and filter systems in the guts of homes, schools, offices, and factories have become a focus of debate. People know that if they want to go back inside those buildings—even while masked and 6 feet away from each other—something has to vent potentially virus-infused air. That means a renewed interest in HVAC, and possibly a new future for an often-overlooked field of science. Maybe. “The best HVAC in the world performs poorly when it’s not well maintained, and the usual standard is ‘not well maintained,’” Siegel says. “What we’re seeing now in the pandemic is that people want HVAC to help us, and it’s like, wait a second—you’ve systematically underinvested and not done the kinds of things you should do to have a well-functioning system.”

On the other hand, that might mean a new future for ventilation is emerging, and along with it a new way of seeing the future of building design and engineering—because trying to Covid-proof a home or office might make it better in all sorts of other ways, too.

SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory coronavirus that almost certainly has among its modes of transmission the ability to move almost like a vapor, in invisible bubbles of snot and spit or dessicated protein that waft on air currents, emitted by people showing no symptoms of illness. Transmission is most common indoors, where the air doesn’t exchange as often as it does outside. So one of the biggest ideas for decreasing transmission but still letting people go back to school and work safely—not to mention places like restaurants, theaters, and bookstores—is ventilation: getting potentially infectious viral particles in the air out, and clean air in. “Those of us in this field have been arguing for decades that we need to pay attention to the indoor environment, and we’re thrilled people are recognizing it’s important. But how to get from here to there will take an infusion of investment,” says Shelly Miller, a mechanical engineer at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies indoor air. “We view outside air and water as shared goods. This is something everybody shares. I don’t really see why it would be any different from the air in a building, because lots of people share the air in the building. We just haven’t looked at it that way.”","['hvac', 'covid', 'better', 'buildings', 'filter', 'outside', 'building', 'transmission', 'way', 'ventilation', 'breathe', 'dilemma', 'future', 'siegel', 'air']"

Hazard and Casemiro both face a spell on the sidelines

Real Madrid duo Eden Hazard and Casemiro have both tested positive for coronavirus and will now undergo a period of self-isolation.

The 29-year-old Belgium forward and the 28-year-old Brazil midfielder will now miss Sunday's trip to Valencia.

In a statement, Real said that they were the only positive results after testing on Friday.

Real's Brazil defender Eder Militao is also ruled out after testing positive earlier this week.

Hazard had been named in the Belgium squad for their upcoming internationals, including against England on 15 November, despite limping off after 65 minutes during Real's 3-2 victory against Inter Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday.","['testing', 'madrid', 'coronavirus', 'positive', 'eden', 'brazil', 'belgium', 'updated', 'test', 'real', 'hazard', 'casemiro', 'valenciain', 'weekhazard', 'upcoming', 'victory']"

Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, who said that the Trump administration had “basically thrown in the towel” on trying to control the pandemic, while Mr. Biden and his team have nothing to wield but “moral power and social power” until Jan. 20.

“Without significant action,” he said, “the idea that we have another 100,000 deaths by Inauguration Day would be a conservative estimate.”

Experts pointed to a number of steps a yet-to-be-sworn-in President-elect Biden could take to help control the pandemic. The options range from making a behind-the-scenes push for governors to issue mask orders and for Congress to supply more money for coronavirus testing, all the way up to a national lockdown if cases are still spiraling after Mr. Biden takes office.

Mr. Biden has said he wants to “shut down the virus, not the country.” But as he also vows to do “whatever it takes” to control the pandemic, the millions of Americans who turned out to vote in record numbers last week remain deeply split on how best to go about it.

“I’m anticipating the next shutdown,” said Voizene Stewart, 53, of Detroit, who said he voted for Mr. Biden after losing both his mother and his 34-year-old son to the coronavirus. Though virus cases in the county that includes Detroit are below peak levels from this spring, they have been rising steadily, with nearly 500 infections a day reported on average over the last week.

Even though he has gone months without spending significant time with his remaining children and grandchildren, he said he hopes that the president-elect will once again restrict businesses and urge people to stay home. “We need to get back to that,” he said. “They opened too early.” He noted with concern that the grocery store across the street from his home, which used to be quiet, was once again bustling with people; many customers emerging from the store on Sunday were wearing masks.","['mr', 'surge', 'coronavirus', 'virus', 'pandemic', 'takes', 'significant', 'presidentelect', 'lap', 'bidens', 'land', 'terrifying', 'power', 'control', 'store', 'biden']"

I recently requested an exception to the rule because I need a dog as an emotional-support animal. The board rejected my request, claiming that because there is no definitive proof that dogs cannot spread coronavirus to humans, permitting one in the building endangers the health of residents. This seems absurd to me. Can the board really reject my request on these grounds? What can I do to appeal the decision?

A: Your condo’s argument against an emotional-support animal is not rooted in the current science about Covid-19, or in disability law. The Mayo Clinic notes that “experts don’t consider animals to be a significant way that coronavirus spreads.” There is no evidence that viruses can spread to people from a pet’s skin, fur or hair, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

Federal, state and city laws prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities and require buildings to provide reasonable accommodations. So even in a pet-free building, when a resident with a disability needs an emotional-support animal, the board must accommodate the request.

“The condo’s claim that dogs might spread Covid seems absurd on its face,” said Darryl M. Vernon, a Manhattan real estate lawyer who represents owners of companion animals, noting that the science overwhelmingly points to people as the vectors. “That we know for sure,” Mr. Vernon said. “So by the condo’s inane reasoning, they should not allow people in the building anymore, either.”","['covid', 'pose', 'buildings', 'risk', 'apartment', 'request', 'pets', 'emotionalsupport', 'building', 'animal', 'science', 'manhattan', 'spread', 'vernon', 'condos', 'board']"

A new study suggests that a small portion of the population carries antibodies that respond to the coronavirus behind covid-19 without having been infected —antibodies lifted from previous bouts with the common cold caused by related viruses.

The research is the latest to indicate that some people may have a degree of preexisting immunity to the coronavirus. But though it’s possible these findings could help explain some trends in the pandemic, such as children being less vulnerable to severe illness, it’s still unclear just how protective this borrowed immunity could really be.

The new study, published in Science on Friday, tested blood samples collected from adults and children in the UK prior to the known start of the pandemic in December 2019, as well as from people early on in the pandemic who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for covid-19. These samples were compared to people who had confirmed covid-19.

As expected, most of the confirmed cases had a diverse group of antibodies geared to respond to the virus’s spike protein, used by the virus to infect cells. These came from all three of the antibody types that combat viral infection (IgG, IgM, IgA). But in some uninfected patients, including those confirmed to have a recent common cold coronavirus infection, the researchers also found antibodies that appeared to react to SARS-CoV-2. “Our results from multiple independent assays demonstrated the presence of preexisting antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV-2 in uninfected individuals,” the researchers wrote.

The antibodies found in the uninfected people were clearly distinct from those in covid-19 patients. They were almost all IgG, the most common antibody made by the immune system. They were also only found in a small percentage of adults. In samples from 302 adults, only 16 (5.26%) carried these antibodies. However, that wasn’t as true for children: The researchers found these antibodies in 21 out of 48 samples (44%) collected from kids between the ages of 1 to 16.

The authors speculate that the higher levels of cross-reactive antibodies seen in children could help explain why they seem less likely to contract covid-19 than the general population, or why they usually experience much less severe illness. Children get sick with minor colds all the time, and they found evidence that more frequent recent infections by other human coronaviruses could explain the higher levels of antibodies in children.

The study is seemingly the first to find these cross-reactive antibodies in people. Yet other research has shown that some people also carry T cells—another crucial part of the immune system—borrowed from earlier common cold infections that can respond to SARS-CoV-2. Together, these studies indicate that some people really could have a preexisting immune response to covid-19. But there’s reason to be cautious in interpreting the results.



“We still don’t know anything about protection, despite a number of groups showing cross-reactivity. The epidemiology shows that cross-reactivity is unlikely to prevent infection or spread—at best it may alter symptoms,” said lead author Kevin Ng, a PhD student and virus researcher at the Francis Crick Institute in London.

There are people who have argued that the T cell studies show that many people in the world are already protected from the pandemic, often to justify their stance against aggressive actions to curtail the spread of the viral illness. However, the scientists behind the research have vocally spoken out about these claims. They’ve noted that there is still much uncertainty about how these cross-reactive T cells could impact a person’s response to infection, and that it’s unlikely having these cells would significantly prevent a person from catching or spreading covid-19 to others. In other words, these T cells aren’t getting us to so-called herd immunity any faster.

Another reason to be cautious: It’s also possible that having cross-reactive antibodies could actually raise the risk of more serious illness in some cases, something known to have happened with the original SARS virus.

In any case, there will have to be more research done to be sure of anything. Aside from helping explain why certain groups of people could be less vulnerable to covid-19 in some way, the researchers speculate that understanding the ins-and-outs of this borrowed immunity could someday lead to better vaccines against both current and future coronaviruses.



“We’re working now to figure out why some people make cross-reactive antibodies and some don’t,” Ng said. “If we can figure that out, we can use that information in vaccines to stimulate an immune response that would theoretically target all coronaviruses.”","['covid19', 'researchers', 'pandemic', 'antibodies', 'common', 'crossreactive', 'colds', 'research', 'thanks', 'sarscov2', 'children', 'infection', 'samples', 'recognize']"

President Donald Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows has tested positive for coronavirus, multiple outlets reported late Friday evening.

The news comes just days after Meadows attended a packed election night rally at the White House with nary a face mask in sight among the few hundred guests, indicating that the Trump administration—having apparently learned nothing from its previous superspreader event—might very likely have a second covid-19 outbreak on its hands on top of a seemingly never-ending presidential election.

Meadows disclosed his diagnosis to his circle of advisers after Tuesday’s election, a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg under the condition of anonymity. That means he either tested positive after Tuesday’s rally, which would suck, or he knew that he was infected and attended the event anyway, which would suck infinitely more! A Trump campaign aide, Nick Trainer, has also reportedly tested positive for the virus, sources told the outlet.

Another White House covid-19 outbreak would be on-brand for the U.S., sad as it is to say. The country set yet another grim global record on Thursday after reporting more than 120,000 new daily coronavirus cases. Its total case tally is quickly approaching the 10 million mark, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.

In October, more than three dozen top politicians, White House staffers, and reporters tested positive for the virus after attending a Rose Garden ceremony where Trump announced Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination. That list includes Trump, his wife, Melania, and youngest son, Barron, as well as Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, Marc Short, former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, and top Trump aide Hope Hicks, among others.

The so-called interim analysis looked at the first 94 confirmed cases of Covid-19 among the more than 43,000 volunteers who got either two doses of the vaccine or a placebo. It found that fewer than 10% of infections were in participants who had been given the vaccine. More than 90% of the cases were in people who had been given a placebo.

Pfizer said that the vaccine, made with German partner BioNTech, had an efficacy rate higher than 90% at seven days after the second dose, which means protection is achieved 28 days after a person begins vaccination. The vaccine requires two doses. The US Food and Drug Administration has said it would expect at least 50% efficacy from any coronavirus vaccine.

In an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on Monday morning, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla called the Covid-19 vaccine ""the greatest medical advance"" in the world's last hundred years.

""Emotions are very high. You can imagine how I felt when I heard the results yesterday at 2 p.m. I think that likely, based on impact, this will be the greatest medical advance in the last 100 years,"" Bourla said.

""It is extraordinary but it's coming at a time that the world needs it the most,"" Bourla said, noting that the United States has recently seen more than 100,000 daily new Covid-19 cases.

In a news release, the pharmaceutical giant said it plans to seek emergency use authorization from the FDA soon after volunteers have been monitored for two months after getting their second dose of vaccine, as requested by the FDA

Pfizer said it anticipated reaching that marker by the third week of November.

In a text message to CNN, Dr. Anthony Fauci called Pfizer's results ""Extraordinarily good news!""

Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he has not seen the vaccine data himself, but he spoke to Bourla Sunday night.

More results to come

There's still more to learn about the Pfizer vaccine.

The Phase 3 trial of the Pfizer vaccine has enrolled 43,538 participants since July 27. As of Sunday, 38,955 of the volunteers have received a second dose of the vaccine. The company says 42% of international trial sites and 30% of US trial sites involve volunteers of racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds.

The final goal of the trial is to reach 164 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection.

The Pfizer vaccine uses a never-before-approved technology called messenger RNA, or mRNA, to produce an immune response in people who are vaccinated.

The mRNA vaccine approach uses genetic material called mRNA to trick cells into producing bits of protein that look like pieces of the virus. The immune system learns to recognize and attack those bits and, in theory, would react fast to any actual infection.

Pfizer said Monday it will evaluate whether the vaccines protects people against severe Covid-19 disease and whether the vaccine can provide long-term protection against Covid-19 disease, even in patients who have been infected before.

""How long this protection lasts is something we don't know,"" Bourla told CNN.

It's not clear whether the Covid-19 vaccine will become a yearly or season shot, but Bourla believes it's likely.

""I think it is a likely scenario that you will need periodical vaccinations,"" Bourla told Gupta. ""The reason why we selected the RNA technology was exactly that. This is a technology that you can boost without problems of creating antibodies against your vaccine, again and again and again.""

So far, the vaccine hasn't shown any safety concerns, Bourla said.

""What we know right now -- it is with very, very high level of confidence these are very highly effective vaccines. What we know so far, it means that we don't have any safety concerns, but we need to wait until the results are there,"" Bourla said.

More than a billion doses expected in 2021

Bourla told CNN that Pfizer expects to have 50 million vaccine doses globally this year, and 1.3 billion next year.

""Who will get this vaccine? We have two separate manufacturing lines. One is in the US,"" Bourla said. ""Those we prefer using mainly for Americans.""

Bourla added that a second line in Europe will be used to produce vaccines for the rest of the world. ""We have already signed contracts with multiple governments in the world and they have placed orders,"" Bourla said.

The vaccine will be free to all American citizens, Bourla said.

Pfizer's vaccine was not developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, the US government's coronavirus vaccine effort.

The federal government has invested $1.95 billion in Pfizer's vaccine to help it manufacture a billion doses or more by next year, but it is not helping to test it and Pfizer has said it will distribute the vaccine itself.

President-elect Joe Biden said in a statement the Pfizer announcement is ""excellent news,"" but warned that mask wearing and social distancing are still necessary.

President Donald Trump, who had previously suggested a vaccine might come before Election Day, said in a tweet that the Pfizer announcement was ""SUCH GREAT NEWS!"" and noted the stock market was up.

When asked on Monday about the timing of the Pfizer announcement -- just days after the election -- Bourla said, ""the science brought it exactly at this time.""

""We announced it the moment we learned about it, and I said multiple times the election for us is an artificial timeline,"" Bourla said.

A top White House coronavirus adviser has resisted widespread testing, pushing for a form of herd immunity instead. Dr. Scott W. Atlas, a White House coronavirus adviser, has dismissed calls for more widespread testing and isolation as “grossly misguided.” Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times In late September, a Nobel Prize-winning economist emailed Dr. Scott W. Atlas, a White House coronavirus adviser, in what he saw as a last-ditch effort to persuade the Trump administration to embrace a dramatic increase in testing and isolating infected patients. The plan was designed to appeal to President Trump, who has complained that positive tests make his administration look bad and would not “generate any new confirmed cases.” Dr. Atlas, a radiologist, told the economist, Paul Romer of New York University, that there was no need to do the sort of testing he was proposing. “That’s not appropriate health care policy,” Dr. Atlas wrote. Dr. Atlas went on to reference a theory that the virus can be arrested once a small percentage of the United States population contracts it. He said there was a “likelihood that only 25 or 20 percent of people need the infection,” an apparent reference to a threshold for so-called “herd immunity” that has been widely disputed by epidemiologists. The call for more widespread testing and isolation, Dr. Atlas wrote, “is grossly misguided.” The exchange highlights the resistance within the White House toward adopting a significantly expanded federal testing program, including efforts to isolate infected patients and track the people they have been in contact with, even as infections and deaths continue to rise nationwide. That resistance has become a sticking point in negotiations over a new economic stimulus package, with the administration and top Democrats disagreeing over the scope and setup of an expanded testing plan. Many public health experts, and some economists like Mr. Romer, say that a far more sweeping testing program would save lives and boost the economy by helping as many Americans as possible learn quickly if they are sick — and then take steps to avoid spreading the virus. Dr. Atlas and other administration officials playing influential roles in the government’s virus response effectively say the opposite: that more widespread testing would infringe on Americans’ privacy and hurt the economy, by keeping potentially infected workers who show no symptoms of the virus from reporting to their jobs.

The spread through rural America has created problems in small towns that lack key resources. Hundreds of inmates have been infected inside the Cascade County Detention Center in Great Falls, Mont. Credit... Tailyr Irvine for The New York Times The Mountain West, which for months avoided the worst of the pandemic, has rapidly devolved into one of the most alarming hot spots in the United States, which recorded its eight millionth confirmed case on Thursday. Seventeen states, including many in the Mountain West, have added more cases in the past week than any other week of the pandemic. And the spread through sparsely populated areas of rural America has created problems in small towns that lack critical resources — including doctors — even in ordinary times. Wyoming, which did not have 1,000 total cases until June, recently added more than 1,000 in a single week. Reports of new infections have recently reached record levels in Alaska, Colorado and Idaho. And Montana, where more than half of the state’s cases have been announced since August, is averaging more than 500 cases per day. One place where the infections have spread has been local jails, which are confined, often crowded spaces. They are risky venues for inmates and workers, but the short-term holding facilities also pose a threat for surrounding communities because people filter in and out of them constantly. For months, the jail in central Montana’s Cascade County was free of the coronavirus, which seemed as distant a threat as it did in much of the rural Mountain West. Then a few people who had the virus were arrested. By the time Paul Krogue, the jail’s medical director, realized there was a problem, nearly 50 inmates were infected. After weeks battling to contain the outbreak, Mr. Krogue got a call that infections were spreading to a side of the jail that had been virus-free. “I just kind of lost it, like, ‘My God, I don’t know how much longer I can do this,’” Mr. Krogue, a nurse practitioner, recalled. “I was just scared that I’m not going to be able to see it through, that I’m going to get sick — you just feel so exhausted and it’s just a lot.” Now more than 300 inmates and staff members have been infected in a facility meant to hold 365 people, Cascade County’s first major outbreak in a region where the virus is suddenly surging.

The first U.S. distribution plan for vaccines uses CVS and Walgreens to get any approved to those in long-term care. A Walgreens in Lake Charles, La., after Hurricane Laura passed through in August. Credit... Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters The Trump administration said Friday that it would contract with CVS and Walgreens pharmacies to provide free coronavirus vaccines, once they are available, to residents of long-term care centers around the country, offering one of the first clues into how vaccines will be distributed. The partnership will “provide convenient and free vaccination to residents of nursing homes across America, another historic achievement in our efforts to get a safe and effective vaccine to Americans as fast as possible,” Alex Azar, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a prepared statement. No coronavirus vaccines are currently ready for approval by the Food and Drug Administration, and the timeline for their deployment is unclear. However, the statement said that the program, called the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-term Care, is being established with its goal of having at least one vaccine available by the end of the year. The vaccines under the program would to be available for residents in skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, residential care homes, and adult family homes as well as staff members who have not been previously vaccinated. The plan is part of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration’s multibillion-dollar high-speed effort to develop and distribute coronavirus vaccines. Four companies are testing coronavirus vaccines in late-stage clinical trials in the United States. Pfizer has been the most aggressive in its timeline estimates, but its chief executive said today that it would not apply for emergency authorization before the third week of November. The other three companies — Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson — have said that later in the year is more likely, matching the predictions of federal health officials. AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson’s trials have been paused for potential safety concerns, which could further delay their outcomes.

Europe roundup Belgium shuts bars and restaurants and imposes a curfew to halt a spike in cases. Empty seats in a restaurant on Brussels’ Grand Place. The Belgian government announced strict new virus measures on Friday. Credit... Francois Lenoir/Reuters Belgium will impose a nationwide curfew and shut all cafes, bars, and restaurants for a month starting Monday. The curfew will be in place from midnight to 5 a.m., and alcohol sales will be forbidden after 8 p.m. Companies must allow employees to work from home, and gatherings in private homes should be restricted to four visitors, officials said. The measures will be re-evaluated in two weeks. Belgium has recorded more than 48,000 cases over the past seven days, roughly a quarter of the total 191,959 cases it has seen since the start of the pandemic. Of more than 10,000 deaths, 200 have occurred in the last week. “To some people those measures may appear unjust, but this virus is unjust,” Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said at a news conference. “It attacks disproportionately those most vulnerable.” He added that although Belgians were attached to their freedoms, they were also attached to their health. The country has had an uneven path through the pandemic. It had one of the world’s highest per capita death rates through much of the spring, as the virus tore through nursing homes while hospitals refused to accept infected residents. And in late September, the country eased restrictions even though infections were on the upswing. In other developments around Europe: Prime Minister Sanna Marin of Finland said she had left a European Union summit in Belgium “as a precautionary measure” and was returning home to undergo a coronavirus test, The Associated Press reported. She had attended a meeting in Finland on Wednesday with a lawmaker who later tested positive for the virus. Ms. Marin’s announcement came a day after the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, left the summit because one of her close staff members tested positive. Also Friday, a special European Union meeting on China scheduled for next month in Berlin was canceled as cases in the German capital continued to rise. Greece imposed a lockdown on the northern region of Kozani on Friday, closing shops and restaurants and banning travel outside the region after a spike in new cases. The restrictions will apply until Oct. 29. Kozani is the first Greek region to reimpose such measures, and will also ban gatherings and require face masks in public. Schools remain open. Although Greece has done relatively well in curbing the spread of the virus compared to its European neighbors, recording just under 24,000 cases and 482 deaths, recent weeks have seen cases rise. A Berlin court ruled against a city order that forced bars and restaurants to close at 11 p.m., but upheld a ban on alcohol sales starting at the same time. The decision, in which the justices said that it was not apparent that the rule on closings would help to contain the virus, came less than a week after the restrictions went into effect. The justices relied on data from health authorities who found that most new infections come from private parties or institutions like senior homes, hospitals, places of worship, or travel. City officials had not yet decided whether to appeal.

Under rules starting Friday in Scotland, couples who marry or enter into civil partnerships will no longer be required to wear face masks during the ceremony. In workplaces, masks will now be mandatory in cafeterias, except for when seated at a table, and, starting Monday, face coverings will be required in communal areas in offices. The country already requires face masks to be worn on public transport, in shops and other indoor public spaces. Monika Pronczuk, Karen Zraick, Anna Schaverien, Christopher F. Schuetze and

‘We are headed in the wrong direction’: The U.S. records its highest tallies since July. A coronavirus test site in Milwaukee, Wisc., this month. Credit... Alex Wroblewski/Reuters As the coronavirus caseload in the United States soars past eight million, epidemiologists warn that nearly half of the states are seeing surges unlike anything they experienced earlier in the pandemic. Reports of new cases this month have trended upward in all but 11 states, and more than 65,000 cases were announced across the country on Thursday, the most in a single day since July. An additional 70,000 were announced on Friday, as nine states set single-day case records. Uncontrolled outbreaks in the Midwest and Mountain West are driving the surge, according to a New York Times database. Some of the states with the most extreme growth had relatively few cases until recently, and rural hospitals have been strained. Per capita, North Dakota and South Dakota are adding more new cases than any states have since the start of the pandemic. Wisconsin — which reported more than 4,160 new cases on Friday, a single-day record for the state — has seven of the 10 metropolitan areas in the United States with the highest rates of recent cases. The U.S. Surgeon General, Jerome M. Adams, traveled to Neenah, Wisc., to announce the opening of a testing site there in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus in the state. He said on Friday that Wisconsin is “one of our red states, meaning your positivity rates are over 10 percent.” The state’s positivity rate is 21 percent, according to a New York Times database, meaning that about one in five tests come back positive. In Minnesota, officials reported 2,290 new cases on Friday, surpassing the state’s previous single-day record, which was 1,516 new cases reported on Oct. 10. “What’s happening in the Upper Midwest is just a harbinger of things to come in the rest of the country,” said Michael Osterholm, an infectious-diseases expert at the University of Minnesota. Further west, Colorado, Montana and New Mexico — fueled in part by a surge in the county that includes Albuquerque — were among the 19 states that were reporting seven-day records as of Thursday night. New infections are also emerging at record levels in Idaho and Wyoming. Officials in Wyoming, the least populous state in the country, reported 290 new cases on Friday, a single-day record. Officials in New Mexico have identified more than 3,520 new cases of the coronavirus over the past week, the most of any seven-day stretch of the pandemic. On Friday, the state set its third single-day record in a row with more than 810 new cases. In Utah, the University of Utah hospital intensive care unit hit 104 percent capacity on Friday, Mayor Erin Mendenhall of Salt Lake City said. New cases per day in the state have reached record levels in recent days. April 10 31,709 new cases (7-day avg.) July 19 66,690 Oct. 13 52,156 March 1 New cases per day in the United States Oct. 13 April 10 31,709 new cases (7-day avg.) July 19 66,690 Oct. 13 52,156 March 1 New cases per day in the United States Oct. 13 April 10 31,709 new cases (7-day avg.) July 19 66,690 Oct. 13 52,156 March 1 New cases per day in the U.S. Oct. 13 April 10 31,709 new cases (7-day avg.) July 19 66,690 Oct. 13 52,156 March 1 New cases per day in the United States Oct. 13 Signs of the uptick are already appearing east of the Mississippi River. In the Northeast, where cases have been relatively low since a spring surge, the number of new ones is moving upward again. And in the South, where cases spiked this summer, there are worrisome trends in West Virginia and Kentucky. The number of cases alone is not a full measure of the nation’s outbreak, in part because they come at a time when testing is more widespread than it was a few months ago. Deaths from Covid-19 have also been relatively flat in recent weeks, with an average of about 700 per day. Still, said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, “we are headed in the wrong direction.” “That’s reflected not only in the number of new cases but also in test positivity and the number of hospitalizations,” she added. “Together, I think these three indicators give a very clear picture that we are seeing increased transmission in communities across the country.” High levels of infection in colleges and universities, Dr. Osterholm said, are serving as one source of the spread. Transmission also has been prevalent at events such as funerals, family barbecues and birthday parties, he said, adding that the comeback of sporting events and dining has also added to the spread this fall. “Pandemic fatigue has clearly set in for large segments of the population,” he said. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said on Thursday that the current situation was worrying as winter approaches. But President Trump continued to downplay the resurgence of this virus, saying he did not support the strictest restrictions by local officials to limit its spread. “We’re not doing any more lockdowns,” he said. “We’re doing fine.” Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, Mitch Smith, Mike Ives, Lauren Leatherby, Glenn Thrush, Zach Montague and

Judge upholds Cuomo’s restrictions on religious services in hot spots. Credit... Stephanie Keith/Getty Images A federal judge ruled on Friday that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s new restrictions on services at Roman Catholic churches in parts of New York City that have been hit hard by the coronavirus did not violate the Constitution’s protection of religious freedoms. The ruling, by Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, was the latest legal victory for Mr. Cuomo in his broader efforts to stem a second wave of the virus in New York. Last week, two other Brooklyn federal judges rejected emergency requests by the Diocese of Brooklyn and Orthodox Jewish groups to set aside the state’s new restrictions on religious gatherings in parts of Queens and Brooklyn. Under the governor’s rules, houses of worship in zones with the highest infection rates are limited to 25 percent capacity or a maximum of 10 people, while those in less severe hot spots are allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity. Lawyers for the diocese had argued in court papers that the regulations violated the First Amendment by imposing capacity limits on at least 26 parishes in Queens and Brooklyn. In his decision, Judge Garaufis acknowledged that the diocese had “done everything it could be expected to do and more” to conduct services safely and that the restrictions clearly harmed religious groups. Nonetheless, he wrote, he believed that “based on the evidence submitted, that the state’s policy is guided by science, not a desire to target religious practice” and that the potential risk of blocking the restrictions now was too great to do so. “If the court issues an injunction and the state is correct about the acuteness of the threat currently posed by hot-spot neighborhoods,” he wrote, “the result could be avoidable death on a massive scale like New Yorkers experienced in the spring.” Ed Shanahan and

A letter from more than 1,000 current and former ‘disease detectives’ decries the politicization of the C.D.C. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times More than 1,000 current and former epidemic intelligence officers — the “disease detectives” of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — have signed an open letter decrying the politicization of the agency and calling for it to be restored to its “indispensable role” in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. The letter has been gathering signatures since May, when it was first posted on Medium, but only recently surpassed the 1,000 mark, organizers said. It was republished on Friday with 1,044 signatories by the The Epidemiology Monitor, a trade publication that devoted its entire October edition to calling for a restoration of the C.D.C.’s reputation. The letter speaks to the growing sense of despair inside the disease control centers, where career government scientists are appalled by White House interference in their decision-making and are calling for their director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, to push back. Many fear the Trump administration is doing irrevocable harm to the agency’s reputation. “The absence of national leadership on Covid-19 is unprecedented and dangerous,” the letter states, adding that states and territories “have been left to invent their own differing systems for defining, diagnosing and reporting cases of this highly contagious disease.” When the letter was first written, the authors state, the Covid-19 death toll had surpassed 100,000 in the United States — it is now twice that. “We urgently call upon the American people to demand and our nation’s leaders to allow C.D.C. to resume its indispensable role.” The signatories represent more than one quarter of all the epidemic intelligence officers who have been trained since the service began in 1951, said Dr. Charles Rabkin, who helped organize the petition. There are names of so-called “E.I.S. officers” from every class with the exception of 1953; the first one listed, Dr. Henry R. Shinefield, is 97, Dr. Rabkin said.

U.s. Roundup The virus is back onboard the Navy carrier Theodore Roosevelt. The U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt made its way into San Diego, Calif., in July. Two sailors aboard the ship tested positive for the virus this week. Credit... Gregory Bull/Associated Press Six months after a virus outbreak on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt triggered a political tsunami in Washington that led to the firing of the ship’s captain and the subsequent resignation of his boss — the acting secretary of the Navy — the novel coronavirus has returned to the ship. The Navy said that two sailors aboard the nuclear-powered Roosevelt, which is at sea near San Diego, tested positive for the virus in the past three days. Both of the sailors have been evacuated, and the people aboard the ship with whom they had contact have been quarantined. “The sailors self-reported after experiencing symptoms, received immediate medical treatment, and were transported off the ship for isolation,” said Commander Zach Harrell, a spokesman for the Naval Air Forces. He said that contact tracing aboard the ship had been completed. The reappearance of the virus aboard the Roosevelt immediately sparked worries among crew members who remember the torturous experience of the spring, when an onboard outbreak spread to some 1,100 sailors, and led to a weekslong stay in Guam and the firing of the ship’s commander, Capt. Brett Crozier, after he wrote a widely distributed letter appealing for help. After he was fired by a political appointee of President Trump, the saga took on new meaning. A video of hundreds of cheering sailors yelling “Captain Crozier!” as he departed the aircraft carrier, went viral. Efforts by the acting Navy secretary at the time, Thomas B. Modly, to right the crisis ended up leading to his resignation. In other news from around the United States: At the largest hospital in Utah — the University of Utah hospital in Salt Lake City — the intensive care unit hit 104 percent capacity on Friday, Mayor Erin Mendenhall of Salt Lake City said. “The actions we take in the days ahead will determine whether or not our systems are able to handle our health care needs,” she said. New cases per day in the state have reached record levels in recent days, with 1,470 new cases reported on Friday.

Two members of the U.S. energy secretary ’s security detail have tested positive for the coronavirus, the Department of Energy announced late Thursday. The secretary, Dan Brouillette, has tested negative, but “out of an abundance of caution,” he and his team have cut short a multi-state trip and are driving back to Washington and following C.D.C. guidance, according to a statement by an agency spokeswoman.

Eighteen members of the Yale University men’s hockey team have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to an email sent by a school official Thursday, prompting Yale to pause all in-person varsity and intramural athletics indefinitely.

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published Friday, about an indoor hockey game in Florida in June that has been linked to 15 infections, amplified concerns about the safety of indoor sports . The player believed to have spread the virus developed symptoms the day after the game. Indoor ice rinks, the report said, are an ideal transmission environment because of the deep breathing that happens during intense exertion and the proximity between players during the game and in the locker rooms.

A Republican candidate for the state legislature in North Dakota , David Andahl, died of Covid-19 earlier this month, his family said. While his name will remain on the ballot, the state’s attorney general said in an opinion this week that the North Dakota G.O.P. will choose who will fill the seat if Mr. Andahl wins.

Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey announced an administrative shakeup at the state’s Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, which runs nursing homes where 190 residents’ deaths have been linked to the coronavirus. A new commissioner of the department was named on Friday and directors at two state-run nursing homes, where outbreaks are being investigated by the state attorney general, are being replaced.

Trick-or-treating advice: Wear a mask under your mask. Better yet, stay home. Halloween items for sale at a home improvement retailer store in Alhambra, California last month. Credit... Frederic J. Brown/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images As the coronavirus pushes the curve of U.S. infections upward for a third time, public officials and families are rethinking how to celebrate Halloween, balancing the risk of increased transmission with the interests of a public reluctant to give up holiday traditions. In several states, including California and Massachusetts, governors have discouraged trick-or-treating but not issued an outright ban. Public health experts, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have warned that the practice could lead to a spike in cases. “I’m advising people to stay home,” said Dr. Dean A. Blumberg, the chief of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Division at the University of California Davis Children’s Hospital. “It doesn’t seem worth it to me. It doesn’t seem worth the risk, not only for the family to risk transmission but for the community to result in outbreaks like we saw after Memorial Day.” The C.D.C., in its Halloween safety guidelines, classified traditional trick-or-treating as a high-risk activity, along with indoor haunted houses and crowded costume parties. The agency, along with some public officials, is imploring families to find new, safer ways to celebrate. They suggest costume contests via Zoom, candy scavenger hunts in the home or yard and scary movie nights. If a family does decide to trick-or-treat, experts have urged families and children to wear protective masks in addition to costume masks. Teresa Tomb, one of the organizers of an annual Halloween parade in Lexington, Ky. — the theme of which combines zombies with Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” — said the city canceled the parade this year, but replaced it with a socially distant, multi-day gathering at a park, where people can dress up and dance in their zombie costumes. “You kind of reach a certain acceptance that this is what we have to do,” she said. “It will just be a special year.”

In Israel, some ultra-Orthodox choose home care over hospitalization. In the Old City of Jerusalem this week. Israel imposed a second national lockdown after infection and death rates soared to among the highest in the world. Credit... Atef Safadi/EPA, via Shutterstock A small charity in Jerusalem is offering an under-the-radar service treating mostly ultra-Orthodox and older Covid-19 patients in their homes, even in severe cases where health experts say it could endanger lives. Drawing on the services of a few doctors — and dozens of volunteers, most without medical training — it operates out of a basement in Mea Shearim, a Jerusalem stronghold of the most extreme anti-Zionist Jewish sects that shun cooperation with the state. The charity has attracted patients who sense that remaining with family — and avoiding public hospitals — outweighs the risks. But the project is also tinged with a general distrust of government among the ultra-Orthodox community, which appears to be increasingly going it alone in handling the pandemic and many other aspects of daily life. Since the home-care initiative was reported by Israel’s N12 news service this week, health officials and experts have responded with a mix of condemnation and curiosity. Dr. Sharon Elrai-Price, a senior Health Ministry official, denounced the operation as a “dangerous” departure and said the ministry was looking into the legality of some aspects of it. But Dr. Gabriel Barbash, a leading Israeli professor of epidemiology, is among those who view the charity’s approach as a possible way to ease the load on hospitals and worthy of further study. The debate comes as Israel is under its second national lockdown after daily infection and death rates soared to among the highest in the world, and ultra-Orthodox areas top the virus hot spots. Health officials say that about 50 percent of those aged over 65 and under 18 who are infected in Israel are from the ultra-Orthodox community, though it makes up no more than 13 percent of the country’s nine million citizens. The actual infection numbers may be even higher: The charity does not report coronavirus cases to the authorities, which may be skewing the national virus data on which policymakers base their decisions.

There are many coronavirus tests. None can tell if someone is contagious. A health worker displays positive (right) and negative results of coronavirus antigen tests. Credit... Sergio Perez/Reuters In a flurry of memos released this week and last, the White House physician, Dr. Sean Conley, declared that President Trump no longer posed a transmission risk to others — an assessment, he noted, that was largely based on the results of “advanced diagnostics.” Outside experts have also said that Mr. Trump, who reportedly began feeling sick about two weeks ago, is probably no longer contagious. But in fact there exists no test that can definitively determine whether someone who was infected with the coronavirus can still spread it. “We do not have a test for cure, and we do not have a test for infectiousness,” said Omai Garner, a clinical microbiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Not all coronavirus tests are designed to detect the same parts of the virus. And a negative on one test does not necessarily guarantee a negative on another. As recently as Tuesday, for instance, a rapid antigen test called the BinaxNOW was unable to detect the coronavirus in Mr. Trump. But results yielded from a laboratory test, which used a slower but more accurate technique called polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., showed he still carried genetic material from the virus at low levels in his body. “We don’t just look at these tests in the context of ‘Coronavirus, yes or no,’” said Karissa Culbreath, a clinical microbiologist at TriCore Reference Laboratories in New Mexico. There is no definitive threshold at which researchers can say someone is or is not infectious, she said, and it’s very possible to be antigen negative but P.C.R. positive.

Keuka College sends students home because of coronavirus outbreak. Keuka College is located on the shores of Keuka Lake in New York’s Finger Lakes region Credit... Neil Johnson/Keuka College A small college in Central New York is sending most of its students home, possibly for the rest of the fall semester, because of a sudden coronavirus outbreak that has been traced to a single off-campus party on Oct. 3, college officials said on Friday. Keuka College, which had experienced just one case of coronavirus during its first six weeks of classes, now has 55 active cases, most of which have been linked to the party. The school has asked most of its 1,100 students to leave campus this week, urging them to isolate themselves as best they can for two weeks once they get home. Though the school has left open the possibility of allowing some students to return before the Thanksgiving break, the college president, Amy Storey, said “the bar is set very high.” About 250 students will remain on campus because they have tested positive or have come into close contact with someone who has; are showing Covid symptoms; or have an unstable home situation. “We had hoped this step wouldn’t be necessary,” Ms. Storey said in a statement, “but the quickly escalating number of positive cases has made this temporary shut-down unavoidable.” She added that the school was compelled to send students home because its small campus lacked sufficient housing to isolate the growing number of infected and possibly infected students. Like most American colleges, Keuka had planned to send students home for the semester around Thanksgiving, to reduce the kind of travel that often spreads the virus. But in sending them home , it may be providing a preview of what other colleges are likely to face as infections rise across the country. The New York Times has identified more than 178,000 confirmed cases at colleges and universities since the pandemic began, most of those cases being reported since students began returning to campuses in August. In an interview, Ms. Storey said the college has been testing only symptomatic individuals, without conducting the kind of random surveillance testing experts say is needed to spot outbreaks swiftly. The strategy seemed to be working up until about 85 to 100 students attended the Oct. 3 party, Ms. Storey said. Though a number of students who have “flouted” the guidance and rules, the vast majority of students have complied, “which is what makes this situation so tragic,” she said.","['testing', 'false', 'positive', 'covid19', 'cases', 'coronavirus', 'virus', 'states', 'dr', 'nfl', 'students', 'tests', 'officials', 'health', 'week', 'team', 'thrown']"

Verily uses language in its privacy policy that says it can share people’s information with third parties involved in the testing program.

Dr. Noha Aboelata, CEO of Roots Community Health Center in Oakland who worked with Verily to establish a walk-up site at her clinic, echoed the task force’s concerns. She found that the people who registered through Verily for testing tended to be white — her clinic mostly serves African Americans and other PoCs — and to come from wealthier ZIP codes outside of East Oakland. The doctor severed her ties with Verily after only six days.

Dr. Jonathan Fuchs, who leads San Francisco County’s testing strategy, confirmed to Kaiser that the partnership with Verily is “currently on hold.” Verily spokesperson Kathleen Parkes told the publication, though, that conversations with San Francisco and Alameda remain “active.” In addition, she explained that the testing program requires a Gmail account so that it can use Google’s authentication procedures to protect people’s sensitive data.

Update 10/27/20 1:25PM ET: A Verily spokesperson has disputed KHN’s claims and told Engadget that the company has never severed ties with the counties. They said:

""We are currently working with multiple counties in the Bay Area, and the counties of Alameda, SF and city of Oakland never severed ties with Verily. Many of the sites in these regions were established as short-term testing centers and not intended to operate for longer periods of time. The Allen Temple site in Oakland was donated by a local church for a finite period of time, for example. We were in the process of establishing a new site with SF, but were directed by the state to relocate that capacity to San Diego in the last week of September. ""

In addition, the spokesperson said Verily has a system called “Assisted Accounts” specifically for individuals who want to sign up for testing but do not have regular internet access. And as for concerns about privacy, the company said it employs security controls for the program “that map to the HIPAA Security Rule and operates under CCPA.”","['testing', 'spokesperson', 'covid19', 'update', 'counties', 'responds', 'verilys', 'san', 'verily', 'drop', 'site', 'concerns', 'severed', 'francisco', 'oakland', 'ties', 'service']"

Users of the state coronavirus app in England and Wales were alarmed to see their area’s risk level fluctuate out of nowhere on Friday in what turned out to be a technical glitch, the Guardian reports. As if anyone needed more stress this year.

The Department of Health and Social Care said on Saturday that the bug affected updates to the app’s postcode alert system and it has since been resolved.

“We are aware of an issue which impacted updates to postcode alerts for some app users this evening,” an agency spokesperson told the outlet. “This was identified and resolved within an hour and users’ phones will automatically update to show the correct local alert level for their area, along with new guidance.”

This is far from the app’s first glitch, though. In the few weeks since it went live throughout the UK, the National Health Service’s contact-tracing app has been an absolute shitshow. A bug at launch prevented users from uploading their covid-19 test results (which is crucial to actually tracking the spread of the virus), and several users have reported receiving notifications warning them of possible exposure only for the message to vanish when they try to check it.

On Friday, several users in England and Wales posted on Twitter that they’d received confusing notifications from the app that contradicted official government reports. Users living in Walsall and Wakefield said they got alerts that the risk level in their respective area had changed to medium, meaning only national restrictions regarding gathering sizes, business operating hours, and face masks are enforced. But according to government guidance found online, both areas are still classified as high risk, a distinction for regions with higher levels of infections that carries heavier restrictions, particularly regarding socializing (households aren’t allowed to hold gatherings of any size indoors, for example).

In London, where additional lockdown restrictions went into effect at midnight on Friday and the alert level rose from medium to high, users said the app’s alert level for the area remained unchanged. Weirder still, one user there said his app indicated he was in both a high and medium risk area simultaneously, the Guardian reports.

While the Department of Health and Social Care didn’t disclose how many users this bug affected, one expert told Sky News that as many as 4 million people may have received erroneous notifications. Jeremy Place, an information security specialist, said he was monitoring the app when the glitch occurred and that it was almost certainly “a fat finger error” related to a recent update to the app’s alert levels. (Previously, the app’s levels were low, medium, and high, but that has since changed to medium, high, and very high to match the government’s new tier system.)

Place said that a blank file was accidentally pushed out to users in lieu of an actual alert level update under this newly revised system.

“I was monitoring for changes to the app to see whether they were addressing any of the issues that had been raised about confusing risk level messages,” he told the outlet. “I noticed that the file was empty from 18.21 for about an hour.”

Any phone receiving that empty file likely reverted to the app’s old system, thus prompting an incorrect notification that the risk level had changed in a user’s area.

The UK’s road to developing a contact tracing app has been a convoluted mess, so it’s little wonder that the app itself would be just as rife with problems. After trying and failing to develop its own app for months, the British Department of Health and Social Care finally threw in the towel in June and announced it was pivoting to Google and Apple’s API after uncovering several “challenges” during the app’s test run.

Previously, UK officials refused to agree to the tech giants’ user privacy demands and had decided to build their own API from the ground up that, unlike Google and Apple’s, wouldn’t require storing information about users’ contacts locally on those users’ phones as a trade-off for expanding Bluetooth capabilities. However, not only did the solution they came up with not work worth a damn, it was probably illegal to boot. Due to t he way the app was designed, it could potentially exchange identifying information with third parties without users’ knowledge or consent, a clear violation of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation.

So I mean, I guess this is an improvement? Though not much of one, to be sure.","['false', 'covid19', 'risk', 'area', 'app', 'alert', 'level', 'nhs', 'users', 'alerts', 'apps', 'high', 'levels', 'medium', 'health', 'sent']"

Garcia has dropped to 40 in the world rankings

The Masters Date: 12-15 November Venue: Augusta National Coverage: Radio and text commentary online with in-play clips. Daily highlights on BBC Two - full details here

Former Masters champion Sergio Garcia will miss this year's event at Augusta after testing positive for coronavirus.

The 40-year-old Spaniard, who won the event in 2017, missed the cut in last week's Houston Open.

""On Saturday night after driving back from Houston, I started feeling a bit of a sore throat and a cough,"" he said.

""The symptoms stayed with me on Sunday morning so I decided to get tested and so did my wife Angela. Thankfully she tested negative, but I didn't.""

This year's Masters starts on Thursday having moved from its traditional early April staging because of the initial Covid-19 outbreak earlier in the year.

Garcia is the second player to have withdrawn because of the virus, after Joaquin Niemann pulled out last week following a positive test result.

The Masters policy is not to replace players who choose to withdraw and this year's field is now at 92 players.

""After 21 years of not missing a major championship, I will sadly miss the Masters this week,"" Garcia said on Twitter. ""The important thing is that my family and I are feeling good. We'll come back stronger and give the green jacket a go next April.""

Garcia has missed the cut on his last two Masters starts and tied an unwanted record for most strokes on a hole in the tournament's history after running up a 13 on the par-five 15th during the first round of his title defence in 2018.","['sergio', 'feeling', 'garcia', 'coronavirus', 'positive', 'miss', 'test', 'tested', 'masters', 'missed', 'withdraws', 'week', 'starts', 'houston']"

The decision has since been put on hold because of questions of legal authority, and the Danish parliament is considering new legislation to authorize the nationwide plan. Culling of mink continues at infected farms and farms within a five-mile radius, so-called safety zones.

Seven countries — Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Italy and the United States — have reported cases of farmed mink infected with the coronavirus to the World Health Organization. A seventh, Greece, has identified two dead mink with the virus and will notify the W.H.O., according to the country’s Agricultural Development Ministry.

And until a loathsome regular named Covid sidled up to the bar, Scott Martin, the owner of Simon’s, a beloved Scandinavian dive in the Windy City’s northern reaches, thought a vomit and diarrhea cleanup kit was the most extravagant thing he was required to have on hand in order to keep his very old watering hole in the government’s good graces.

Suffice to say, he no longer feels that way.

U.S. hospitalizations reach a record high as medical facilities are under strain. Lines for coronavirus testing at the University of Texas at El Paso. Credit... Joel Angel Juarez for The New York Times Covid-19 hospitalizations in the United States hit an all-time high of 61,964 on Tuesday, and new daily cases passed 139,000 for the first time, as the raging pandemic continued to shatter record after record and strain medical facilities. The number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, tallied by the Covid Tracking Project, has more than doubled since September, and now exceeds the peak reached early in the pandemic, when 59,940 hospitalized patients were reported on April 15. A second peak in the summer fell just short of matching that record. Those spikes in April and July lasted only a few days and quickly subsided, but as winter approaches experts do not expect that this time. The United States, which surpassed 10 million known cases on Sunday, is averaging more than 111,000 new cases a day, a record, according to a New York Times database. More than 139,800 new cases were announced in the United States on Tuesday, the highest total of the pandemic. The country has surpassed 100,000 cases every day for a week, pushing the seven-day average to more than 123,000 per day. Four states set single-day case records; 34 states and Guam added more cases in the last week than in any other seven-day stretch. More than 1,440 new deaths were reported on Tuesday, pushing the seven-day average to more than 1,000 new deaths a day for the first time since August 19. While the number of patients continues to climb, a shortage of nurses and other medical personnel is limiting the ability to add more hospital beds to care for them. The critical staff shortage, especially in Western states that struggle to attract doctors and other medical workers even in the best of times, is causing growing alarm, and driving some places to take extraordinary measures. El Paso, a border city of 680,000, now has more people hospitalized with Covid-19 than most states — 1,076 as of Tuesday — and is more than doubling its supply of mobile morgues, to 10 from four. The University Medical Center, a teaching hospital in El Paso, set up tents to care for patients in a parking lot. A downtown convention center became a field hospital, and the state began airlifting dozens of intensive care patients to other cities to free up more space. Gov. Douglas J. Burgum of North Dakota, which has the worst infection and death rates per person in the country, announced on Monday that health care workers who have tested positive but have no symptoms could continue to work in hospitals and nursing homes under certain restrictions, including that they treat only Covid-19 patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines allow the use of asymptomatic personnel during severe staff shortages. Mr. Burgum said his state was about two or three weeks away from facing “severe constraints” in hospital capacity. In Wisconsin, now among the hardest-hit states, a major health care provider, Aurora Health Care, announced it would pause testing sites in Sinai, Green Bay and Kenosha and focus on bedside care, a spokeswoman for the health care system said. Hospitalizations in the greater Milwaukee area have increased fivefold in the past two months. When cases spiked in New York in April and in the South over the summer, health care professionals flew in from elsewhere to help. But now, officials describe a kind of national gridlock. “Everywhere is either hard hit or is watching their Covid numbers go up, and are expecting to get a lot of flu patients,” said Nancy Foster, a vice president of the American Hospital Association. “The ability of health care professionals to pick up and leave their hometowns is very limited.” Neil MacFarquhar and

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a stronger recommendation on wearing masks to reduce the spread of Covid-19. Credit... Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times Breaking from its tentative recommendations on mask use thus far, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday that using masks benefits wearers, which is a step beyond its previous declaration that said wearing masks would only protect those around them. “Experimental and epidemiological data support community masking to reduce the spread” of the virus, the C.D.C. said in a document that details scientific evidence supporting mask use. “Individual benefit increases with increasing community mask use,” it said. The unequivocal statements are a departure from the agency’s previous language, which suggested that “the latest science may convince” Americans to wear masks and that mask use could prevent an infected person from spreading the virus to others. “The main protection individuals gain from masking occurs when others in their communities also wear face coverings,” it said. The agency also offered an economic argument, saying that increasing the proportion of people who wear masks by 15 percent could prevent the need for lockdowns and cut associated losses of up to $1 trillion, or about 5 percent of gross domestic product. The new document listed several studies that “have confirmed the benefit of universal masking,” as well as some observational studies that have given evidence of its usefulness, including an example of two masked hair stylists who had been experiencing symptoms but did not transmit the virus to any of their 67 masked clients who were later contacted. The document also referred to a study of 124 Beijing households in which mask use significantly cut transmission of the virus, and an outbreak aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt in which face coverings appeared to have reduced risk of infection by 70 percent. Experts said they were thrilled to see the change in the C.D.C.’s stance, and particularly the emphasis on face coverings that protect wearers. “That matters for public-health messaging, because we don’t have people yet who are completely convinced about the benefits of masking until they see the C.D.C. say that it also protects you and your family,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious-disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. “I would encourage every American to adhere to masking guidelines now that we hear more clearly today that this will protect you and others,” Dr. Gandhi said. “We cannot afford more lockdowns, but we can do our part to stop Covid-19 transmission and disease.”

Iowa’s governor announces mask requirements for the first time. Students at the School of Classical Ballet & Dance in Des Moines, where mask-wearing is mandatory. In a reversal, Iowa’s governor, Kim Reynolds, announced on Tuesday a mask mandate for some social gatherings. Credit... Kathryn Gamble for The New York Times Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa, who has so far resisted issuing strict mandates during the pandemic, announced new restrictions on Tuesday, including mask requirements for large public gatherings. The new order, which goes into effect Tuesday at midnight, requires masks for indoor gatherings of more than 25 people and outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people. Masks will also be required for customers and employees of certain businesses, including salons, barbershops and tattoo parlors. Spectators at high school and youth sporting events will limited to two per participant. “Iowa is open for business, and we intend to keep it that way,” Governor Reynolds said at a news conference. “That’s why it’s time for these additional mitigation measures.” Over the last few weeks, coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the state have increased sharply, placing Iowa’s health care system at risk of reaching capacity, the governor said. In the last week, there has been an average of 3,888 cases per day in Iowa, according to a New York Times database, a 200 percent increase from 14 days prior. “Like so many states, we’ve reached a serious point of community spread, and we can no longer pinpoint any one age group or type of activity that’s driving it,” Governor Reynolds said. The Iowa governor had previously called mask mandates “feel good” actions, and she has refused to issue a statewide directive and blocked municipalities from enforcing their own edicts. Iowa was one of only a few states that never imposed a full stay-at-home order, and it let restaurants, bars and hair salons reopen earlier than most places.

U.S. health officials detail how people may start to get treatments and, once authorized, vaccines. Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, on Capitol Hill in October. Credit... Michael A. McCoy for The New York Times Federal health officials on Tuesday provided the most detailed projections to date about when a wider swath of Americans may be able to begin to receive Covid-19 vaccines, once any is authorized, and treatments outside of an experimental setting, and about what that could look like. People deemed highest priority — perhaps health care workers or nursing home residents — could be vaccinated in December, with more widespread vaccination to come in the first months of next year, the officials said, laying out an ambitious timeline that could well be thwarted by delays. The forecasting follows two encouraging developments on Monday: positive clinical-trial results from a vaccine front-runner and an emergency authorization for a Covid-19 treatment. The vaccine candidate, made by Pfizer and BioNTech, was found in an early analysis to be more than 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19, and Pfizer is expected to submit its data for review by the Food and Drug Administration once it has the necessary safety data next week. No coronavirus vaccine has yet been authorized by the U.S. federal government. The treatment, a monoclonal antibody developed by the drug maker Eli Lilly similar to the one President Trump had taken, is beginning to be shipped out to states this week. In a series of media appearances on Tuesday, Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, mapped out a potential timeline for distributing Pfizer’s vaccine, if it receives authorization as is widely hoped. In December, the focus would be on vaccinating the most vulnerable groups. Those groups have not yet been determined, but recommendations from experts have zeroed in on health care workers, first responders and older Americans in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, echoed that projection in another appearance on MSNBC on Tuesday, saying that by December, doses would be available “for people who are judged to be at the highest priority.” That’s consistent with remarks Dr. Fauci and other officials have made in recent weeks. By the end of January, Mr. Azar said he expected to have enough vaccine for all health care workers and first responders. (He also added senior citizens to that list in one appearance.) And by the end of March or early April, he expected to have enough of not just Pfizer’s vaccine, but also other vaccines in development, for all Americans, he said. Interim findings are also expected this month from another front-runner in the vaccine race, Moderna Therapeutics. “The particulars are going to depend on seeing that data, and just seeing: Where does it look most effective — which population is it most effective and safe in?” Mr. Azar said on CNBC. The hopeful projections from health officials take for granted that there will be no major delays, which is far from guaranteed. Pfizer’s vaccine results must still be evaluated for safety over a longer time period, data which aren’t expected to be available until next week. The F.D.A. could take longer than expected to evaluate Pfizer’s results. Complications could arise in what is a complex manufacturing and distribution effort. And supply could be further constrained if other experimental vaccines don’t work as hoped. Federal health officials have vowed that Americans will be able to receive Covid-19 vaccines and treatments free of charge. But some seniors will have to pay about $60 to get Eli Lilly’s coronavirus drug, which must be administered via an infusion, federal officials indicated in a phone briefing with reporters on Tuesday. The seniors affected are those on Medicare who don’t have supplemental coverage, and at least for now, they’ll be required to pay a 20 percent coinsurance fee for the administration of the drug, Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department Health and Human Services, told reporters. The drug itself will come at no cost. That same situation will not apply when vaccines become available. “No one will have to pay any out-of-pocket expenses for vaccine administration,” Mr. Mango said.

Italy locks down more regions as a second wave swamps hospitals and the number of new cases keeps rising. Milan on Friday. A significant portion of the country, including the Lombardy region, was put under lockdown by the government last week. Credit... Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times As a brutal second wave of the coronavirus pandemic tests the capacity of the Italian health care system, the government will seal off additional portions of the country on Wednesday, regional governors announced. Unlike the first wave, which was concentrated in the country’s north, the virus is now raging across Italy, from the highly industrialized Milan area to the country’s more precarious south. In an effort to prevent a nationwide lockdown, the government is progressively sealing off and locking down hard-hit areas around the country by assessing their level of risk on a weekly basis. Starting on Wednesday, movement will be strictly limited to and within the central regions of Abruzzo, Umbria and Tuscany, as well as Basilicata in the south and Liguria on the coast, local authorities announced. A significant portion of the country, including the Lombardy region, was put under lockdown by the government last week. As of Nov. 9, the average number of new cases per day over seven days was 32,684, according to a New York Times database, a 92 percent increase from 14 days prior. “Nearly all the Italian regions are highly affected,” said Giovanni Rezza, the director of the prevention department at the Health Ministry, adding that new restrictions were necessary in a situation that “keeps worsening.” With more than half of its beds occupied by coronavirus patients, the San Luigi hospital near Turin, in the highly affected northern region of Piedmont, placed dozens of beds inside the hospital’s chapel and a conference room. Benches, the tabernacle and sacred icons were also moved out of the hospital chapel in Latina, near Rome, to make space for Covid-19 patients. Pictures of nurses distributing oxygen tanks to patients queuing in their cars outside an emergency room in Naples as the hospital scrambled to find empty beds recalled images circulating in the early days of the outbreak, when Italy became the first European country to be hit hard by the coronavirus. Doctors’ warnings also felt familiar. “If the influx of people and hospitalizations stays the same,” Antonio Voza, the emergency-room director at the Humanitas hospital in Milan, told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, “we won’t be able to hold out for a week.” Protests by regional presidents in the locked-down areas have unnerved the government. “Do we get it or not that we are at war?” Pierpaolo Sileri, Italy’s deputy health minister, shouted on Italian television on Sunday. “We are fighting to save Italy.” Last month, as the coronavirus made a resurgence, the government imposed a set of restrictions, including early closings for restaurants and bars, which health authorities said proved successful in flattening the virus’s reproduction rate. But with more than 500 cases per 100,000 people, a nationwide lockdown seems increasingly likely, and some Italians are now wondering whether Italy learned any lessons from the devastating first wave. Andrea Crisanti, a professor of microbiology at the University of Padua and a top scientific consultant on the virus in the Veneto region during the initial outbreak, said that the Italian government missed an opportunity to tame a second wave by failing to set up an efficient contact-tracing system and to sufficiently increase its testing capacity. “We don’t have a plan to get out of this,” Mr. Crisanti said on Italian television. “We have hopes.”

Texas prisons are the highest in the nation for Covid-19 deaths. Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth. Nearly three out of five inmates in Texas jails and prisons who died of the virus were eligible for parole at the time, researchers found. Credit... Larry W Smith/EPA, via Shutterstock Inmates in Texas prisons and jails have tested positive and have died at substantially higher rates than the national average for prisons, and more than half of those who died were eligible for parole at the time, a University of Texas at Austin study found. At least 187 Texas inmates and guards have died, and more than 41,000 have been infected by the coronavirus, according to a New York Times database. By contrast, the federal prison system, which is roughly comparable in size, has had 143 deaths and about 24,000 infections. Of the nation’s 10 largest prison systems, only Florida reported a higher infection rate per 10,000 inmates than Texas, the largest system in the country, and Michigan and Ohio had higher death rates, as of Oct. 4, according to the study. The Texas system has also had by far the most deaths of employees. One Texas prison — the Rufus H. Duncan Geriatric Facility near Diboll — has had nearly 6 percent of its inmates die of Covid-19, the report said. That prison has reported at least 339 infections. The report, published this month by the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, found that Texas has made much less progress in reducing coronavirus deaths in prison than have Michigan, Ohio and New Jersey, which all had high death tolls early in the pandemic. Jeremy Desel, a spokesman for the prison system, said the report failed to properly credit the state for performing universal prison testing, a rarity among correctional systems. “Most inmates have little to no symptoms and recover,” he said, “but tragically, some have succumbed to Covid-19.” Mr. Desel said most of those who died “were elderly and had numerous pre-existing conditions.”

The state’s largest city, Newark, saw the positivity rate over three days last week climb to more than 19 percent. “Stricter measures are required in the city’s hot spots in order to contain the virus and limit the spread,” Mayor Baraka said in a statement. “I know we are all tired, but the virus is not.” It was unclear if the state would step in to restrict Newark’s ability to make its own pandemic-related rules; on Monday, the governor’s top lawyer, Parimal Garg, said that state law superseded municipal orders. The affected Newark ZIP codes — 07104, 07105, and 07107 — include the Ironbound restaurant district, which continues to have the city’s highest rates of positive test results in spite of limits imposed two weeks ago. Residents in the three areas should remain off the street after 9 p.m. on weekdays and 10 p.m. on weekends, unless traveling to or from work, or in the case of an emergency. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio also expressed growing fears about the virus’s resurgence, saying on Tuesday that the seven-day average rate of positive test results citywide had increased to 2.31 percent in what he called a “warning sign” of a potential second wave of infections. At the beginning of September, that figure had dropped below 1 percent. But over the last month, it has been steadily creeping upward, reflecting what city officials said was an increase in transmission within the community, as well as travel-related infections. Health officials are watching cases rise in specific neighborhoods, including Tottenville in Staten Island where the positivity rate exceeded 6 percent the past seven days, according to city data. But the rising numbers could have major implications for all New Yorkers and threaten to bring back the devastation the region experienced in the spring. Mr. de Blasio said on Tuesday that if the seven-day average rate crosses 3 percent public schools would be forced stop in-person instruction and move to remote learning. A continued increase could force the city to shut down some or all businesses again, he added. While hospitals in the city have so far been able to handle new patients, the rise in cases could put a strain on health care, he said, mirroring the difficulties that cities are experiencing nationwide. “And of course the most horrible dilemma, the most horrible consequence: starting to lose lives on a large scale, particularly our elders,” Mr. de Blasio said. “This is our last chance to stop a second wave. If we aren’t able to stop it, there will clearly be lots of consequences that will remind us to much of where we were before.” Statewide, the seven-day rolling average rate of positive test results was 2.23 percent, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York reported on Tuesday. Tracey Tully and

A study finds that many children who have never had the virus carry an antibody to prevent it. Children may carry antibodies effective against the new coronavirus following infections with related viruses, a new study suggests. Credit... Mark Abramson for The New York Times It’s been a big puzzle of the pandemic: Why are children so much less likely than adults to become infected with the coronavirus and, if infected, less likely to become ill? A possible reason may be that many children already have antibodies to other coronaviruses, according to researchers at the Francis Crick Institute in London. About one in five of the colds that plague children are caused by viruses in this family. Antibodies to those viruses may also block SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus causing the pandemic. In a study published Friday in Science, the group, led by George Kassiotis, who leads the Retroviral Immunology Laboratory at the institute, reports that on average only 5 percent of adults had these antibodies, compared with 43 percent of children. In March, as the pandemic was just beginning, Dr. Kassiotis and his colleagues decided to develop a highly sensitive antibody test. To assess it, they examined blood samples taken before the pandemic from over 300 adults and 48 children and adolescents, comparing them with samples from more than 170 people who had been infected with the new coronavirus. The scientists expected samples taken before the pandemic to have no antibodies that attacked the new coronavirus. Those were to be the controls for the test the scientists were developing. Instead, they found that many children, and some adults, carried one antibody in particular that could prevent coronaviruses, including the new one, from entering cells. This antibody attaches itself to a spike that pokes out of coronaviruses. While the new coronavirus has a unique tip on its spike, the base is found in all coronaviruses, Dr. Kassiotis said. In lab tests, antibodies to the base of the spike prevented the new coronavirus from entering cells in order to reproduce. Now the researchers are planning to expand their study to monitor thousands of children and adults. Some have antibodies that can block the new coronavirus in lab tests. Others do not.

Positive test results force the Southeastern Conference to postpone two more college football games. The L.S.U. Tigers at the start of a football game in October. Their game with Alabama was postponed after positive test results and contact-tracing rules left the team short-handed. Credit... Derick E. Hingle/USA Today Sports, via Reuters The Southeastern Conference said Tuesday that it had been forced to postpone two more college football games this weekend, including the fabled Alabama-at-Louisiana-State matchup, because of the pandemic. A game between Texas A&M and Tennessee was also delayed on Tuesday, one day after the league said it had postponed this weekend’s planned matchup between Auburn and Mississippi State. “While it is unfortunate to have multiple postponements in the same week, we began the season with the understanding interruptions to the schedule were possible, and we have remained focused throughout the season on the health of everyone around our programs,” Greg Sankey, the league’s commissioner, said in a statement on Tuesday. “We must remain vigilant, within our programs and in our communities, to prevent the spread of the virus and to manage activities that contribute to these interruptions,” he added. Officials said the games were postponed because positive tests for the virus and contact-tracing rules left L.S.U., Mississippi State and Texas A&M short-handed once other injuries were considered. The SEC, home to 10 of the last 15 national champions in football, is one of the most widely watched and closely scrutinized leagues in American sports. It got through the first several weeks of its delayed, conference-only season with no substantial problems, but the league began to encounter trouble in October, when it first had to postpone games. Although L.S.U., which is 2-3 this season, has hardly lived up to the ordinary standard of a reigning national champion, its game against Alabama was widely anticipated and was to air in prime time. (President Trump attended last season’s game.) It was not clear whether that game would be rescheduled, in part because L.S.U. is already penciled in to play at Florida on Dec. 12, the ordinary landing spot for postponed games. Texas A&M and Tennessee will play on that date, as will Auburn and Mississippi State. In its statement on Tuesday, the league raised the possibility that it would reschedule some games for Dec. 19 — the day the conference title game is scheduled in Atlanta. Nationwide, more than four dozen games involving teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision, college football’s most prominent and lucrative tier, have been postponed or canceled this season for virus-related reasons.

Crowded indoor venues accounted for most virus cases in some cities in the spring, a new analysis shows. Restaurants, gyms, cafes and other crowded indoor venues accounted for some 8 in 10 new coronavirus infections in the early months of the U.S. epidemic, according to a news analysis. Credit... Taylor Glascock for The New York Times Restaurants, gyms, cafes and other crowded indoor venues accounted for some 8 in 10 new coronavirus infections in the early months of the U.S. epidemic, according to a new analysis that could help officials around the world now considering curfews, partial lockdowns and other measures in response to renewed outbreaks. The study, which used cellphone mobility data from 10 U.S. metro areas from March to May, also provides an explanation for why many low-income neighborhoods were hardest hit. The public venues in those communities were more crowded than in more affluent ones, and residents were more mobile on average, likely because of work demands, the authors said in the research published in the journal Nature on Tuesday. The metro areas were Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Washington D.C. Infectious disease models had provided similar estimates of the risk posed by crowded indoor spaces, going back to February; all such models are subject to uncertainties, due largely to unforeseen changes in community behavior. The new analysis provides more precise estimates for how much each kind of venue contributed to urban outbreaks, by tracking hourly movements and taking into account the reductions in mobility from lockdown restrictions or other changes that occurred during those first crucial months. It did not model infection in schools or office workplaces. “Restaurants were by far the riskiest places, about four times riskier than gyms and coffee shops, followed by hotels” in terms of new infections, said Jure Leskovec, a computer scientist at Stanford University and senior author of the new report, in a conference call with reporters. The study was a collaboration between scientists at Stanford, Northwestern University, Microsoft Research and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. Public officials across Europe and in parts of the United States, including Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, have begun to institute partial closures of restaurants and bars, or limited indoor hours, as new infections have surged in recent weeks. In New York City, a spike in virus cases threatens the city’s recovery and could mean “a lot more restrictions,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. These measures are especially important in lower income areas, the new study suggests. Infections exploded in many such communities last spring, and the new model provides one likely explanation: Local venues tend to be more crowded than elsewhere. Grocery stores, for example, typically have some 60 percent more people per square foot, on average, than in more affluent areas, and shoppers stay inside longer. And residents are less able to shelter at home. “We think a big reason for that is that essential workers had to be on the job, they weren’t working from home,” said Serina Chang, a co-author also at Stanford. By focusing on indoor public venues, the researchers could also model the impact of partial restrictions. Limiting restaurant occupancy to one-fifth of capacity, for example, would reduce new infections there by 80 percent, while preserving some 60 percent of customers. “These are important tradeoffs,” Dr. Leskovec said. “Our work highlights that it does not have to be all or nothing,” when implementing restrictions.

global roundup Denmark’s environment minister says a plan to kill all its farmed mink has been suspended. A mass grave being prepared for mink in a military area near Holstebro, Denmark, on Monday. Credit... Morten Stricker/Ritzau Scanpix, via Associated Press Denmark’s plan to kill its farmed mink is on hold because of a question about the government’s legal authority to order the cull, the Danish environment and food minister, Mogens Jensen, said in an interview on Denmark’s TV2 on Tuesday. Last week, Denmark announced that it would kill all its farmed mink because of coronavirus infections and virus mutations. In Tuesday’s interview, Mr. Jensen said he was not aware that the government did not have legal authority to require all healthy mink to be culled. Mink farmers are still encouraged to cull their mink and the government is seeking legal approval, Mr. Jensen said. Farms with coronavirus infections and other farms within a radius of about five miles are required to cull their animals under a pre-existing order. Denmark’s concern is that a mutated variant of the coronavirus that came from mink and that has infected some people could diminish the effectiveness of potential vaccines. The World Health Organization has said there is no evidence yet that vaccines would be affected. And there is no evidence that the mutated virus, one among many existing mutations in both people and mink, is more transmissible or causes more serious illness than any other variant. In other developments around the world: Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian leader and negotiator who passionately advocated the establishment of an independent Palestinian state as a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has died of complications from the virus. He was 65. For three decades, as a close confidant of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and his successor, President Mahmoud Abbas, Mr. Erekat was one of the most prominent voices of the Palestinian cause. Peter Szijjarto, the Hungarian foreign minister, went to Southeast Asia on Nov. 3 to promote trade and investment. He left possibly having infected at least five people in two countries — Thailand and Cambodia — with the coronavirus. Mr. Szijjarto tested positive for the virus upon arrival in Thailand. Schools in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, have shut again, after having opened last week after a long coronavirus closure, as a precaution following the Hungarian foreign minister’s visit.

A coronavirus outbreak in a prison in the central province of Cocle in Panama infected nearly 400 inmates, 75 percent of the inmates at the Penonome prison, according to The Associated Press. No deaths have been linked to the outbreak.

Officials in Singapore and Hong Kong said Wednesday that a travel bubble between the two Asian financial centers will begin this month, on November 22, allowing travelers of all kinds to bypass quarantine. Travelers must test negative for the virus and fly only on designated flights. One designated “bubble” flight will carry a maximum of 200 passengers into each city every day. Travelers from Singapore would be the first allowed to enter Hong Kong since the semiautonomous Chinese territory barred all nonresidents in March.

Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Tuesday that the country was considering opening its borders to several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Australia already has a one-way travel bubble with New Zealand, which allows visitors from that country to enter Australia, but not the other way around. “I think we proceed cautiously,” Mr. Morrison told reporters in Canberra. Returning citizens of the Solomon Islands will be prosecuted if they lie on predeparture forms about their exposure to the coronavirus, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said Monday. “My government will hold these people responsible for endangering our people and our country,” he said in his weekly address to the nation, the local news media reported. The Solomon Islands, which recorded its first coronavirus case last month, now has a total of 16, all of them detected among people in quarantine after arriving from overseas.

Restaurants and nightclubs in Moscow will be forbidden to serve customers between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. for two months to reduce the spread of the virus, Reuters reported. Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, wrote on Tuesday on his website that these measures would be in place from Nov. 13 until Jan. 15. During that period, schoolchildren will also have to stick to online remote learning.

Nepal has resumed free tests and treatment after a court order and as new infections and deaths have increased across the Himalayan country. The government in Kathmandu had been providing free tests and treatment to all virus patients until a month ago. Because of the deepening economic crisis, the government instructed state-run hospitals and labs to begin collecting fees. A group of lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled last week that the government must bear all expenses related to coronavirus tests and treatment.

Brazil halts a Chinese vaccine trial after a ‘serious adverse’ reaction in a participant.

Kevin Frayer/Getty Images Brazil said on Monday that it had halted a late-stage trial of a Chinese vaccine, which had been considered a global front-runner in the race to develop a protective shot for the coronavirus, after a “serious adverse” reaction in a participant. The Brazilian health regulator provided little information on its decision, and did not say whether the reaction was related to the vaccine, called CoronaVac and produced by the Chinese company Sinovac, or coincidental. The participant who had the reaction became ill on Oct. 29, according to the authorities. They did not divulge where in Brazil the vaccine had been administered or what had happened to the volunteer, citing patient confidentiality. In a statement, they said that such a “serious adverse incident” might include death, disability, hospitalization, birth defects or other “clinically significant events.” CoronaVac is one of 11 experimental vaccines, produced by some of the world’s foremost pharmaceutical companies, currently in Phase 3 trials. On the same day that Brazil suspended the Sinovac trial, the American company Pfizer announced that an early analysis of its coronavirus vaccine trials suggested that its drug was more than 90 percent effective in preventing the virus that causes Covid-19. Sinovac’s drug was seen in China as a leading candidate. But in Beijing’s push to get a Chinese vaccine to be the first on the global market, officials stretched the definition of “emergency use.” They have permitted tens of thousands of people to receive the Sinovac vaccine and two other locally made vaccines, despite having not yet concluded Phase 3 trials. Adverse effects are not unusual in Phase 3 trials. AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson both paused their trials after a few volunteers fell seriously ill, resuming them six weeks later, in October, after concluding that the illnesses were not related to the vaccines The details of why the Brazilian health regulator had paused the trials were uncertain. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Sinovac said Instituto Butantan, the medical center coordinating the Brazilian trials, had deemed the “serious event” not related to the vaccine. The company said it was “confident in the safety” of its vaccine. According to news reports, the institute confirmed that a volunteer had died, but officials there said they were “surprised” by the government’s decision to halt the trials. Dimas Covas, head of the institute, told a Brazilian television network that he found the government regulator’s decision strange “because it’s a death unrelated to the vaccine.” Prof. Kim Mulholland, a pediatrician at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia, called it “alarming” that Instituto Butantan appeared to have no idea why the trial had been stopped. “It leaves me wondering who had done that and why,” Professor Mulholland added. “That’s the question that really needs to be answered because this is a violation of the normal process.”

Children have lost basic skills because of school closures, a British survey shows. Children returned to school in Britain in September. Credit... Andrew Boyers/Reuters Children across Britain have lost basic skills and regressed in learning because of school closures resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report released on Tuesday by the government’s school inspection body. While many schools in England reopened in September — and remain open through England’s lockdown this month — the impact of a national lockdown that began in March before being lifted in the summer is now being felt deeply by many students, according to research from Ofsted, the inspection body. Younger children have lost early progress in numbers and words, some who were potty-trained have gone back into diapers, and others have even forgotten how to eat with a knife and fork, school inspectors say. For some children, prolonged isolation means they are having to relearn how to maintain friendships. Older children are struggling with their reading and writing, the research found, and their physical fitness is lacking. There has also been a notable increase in eating disorders and self-harm. Children who coped well with the restrictions were those who had “good support structures around them,” the chief schools inspector, Amanda Spielman, said in a statement. The children hardest hit by the slip in learning were those whose parents couldn’t work flexibly, for whom lockdown meant spending less time with their parents and less time with other children, Ms. Spielman said. The report came as the education minister for Wales announced that older students would not take exams next year to “ensure fairness” as they will have spent different amounts of time in schools during the pandemic. Grades will instead be given based on assessments from teachers.

Mohamad Torokman/Reuters JERUSALEM — Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian leader and negotiator who passionately advocated the establishment of an independent Palestinian state as a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has died. He was 65. His death was confirmed by the hospital, Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem; his daughter and his Fatah party. The hospital said Mr. Erekat, who had previously had a lung transplant, was admitted in critical condition on Oct. 18 with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. He required immediate ventilation and resuscitation. After his condition did not improve, died from multiple organ failure. For three decades, as a close confidant of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and his successor, President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, Mr. Erekat was one of the most prominent voices of the Palestinian cause. As the chief negotiator for the Palestinians, he was one of the main authors of key parts of the landmark Oslo peace accords of the 1990s, the first agreements between the Israelis and the Palestinians, which established Palestinian self-government in parts of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Although his public statements sometimes gave him the image of a firebrand, he was liked and respected by many of his American and Israeli counterparts, who found the Western-educated diplomat frank and knowledgeable. Mr. Erekat was initially treated at home when he became ill with the virus, but on Oct. 18, he was taken to Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem in an ambulance. His life’s ambition of helping to bring about Palestinian statehood and an end to Israeli occupation eluded him, a source of frustration. “I’m not finished with what I was going to do,” he recently messaged Tzipi Livni, the former Israeli foreign minister and one of his main negotiating partners. “I overcame a lung transplant, and I’ll defeat this Covid.”

‘Lockdown’ is a British dictionary’s word of the year. Déborah Lefèvre taking in Paris from her window during the lockdown in April. Credit... Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times Lockdown, something experienced, dreaded and needed by much of the world in 2020, is Collins English Dictionary’s word of the year. The dictionary defines the word as “the imposition of stringent restrictions on travel, social interaction, and access to public spaces.” But most of us are pretty familiar with it. “Our lexicographers chose ‘lockdown’ as Word of the Year because it is a unifying experience for billions of people across the world, who have had, collectively, to play their part in combating the spread of Covid-19,” Collins said on its website. The dictionary counted over a quarter of a million uses of the word this year, up from 4,000 last year. Other words that made the short list were “coronavirus” — “any of a group of viruses that cause infectious illnesses of the respiratory tract, including Covid-19” — “self-isolate” and “furlough.”

Malasig/EPA, via Shutterstock President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has named as his national police chief an officer who drew public ire this year for violating pandemic restrictions. The appointment of Maj. Gen. Debold Sinas, who was previously the police chief of metropolitan Manila, was announced on Monday by Mr. Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque. General Sinas was among 19 police officers charged in May with violating social-distancing rules after his birthday party was held at the police headquarters in Manila during a lockdown. At the time, the government said the charges proved its commitment to stamping out misbehavior by officials. Mr. Roque defended General Sinas’s appointment, saying he had been a “big help” in Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs, which has left thousands dead since the president took office in 2016. General Sinas is required to retire when he turns 56 next May. “Let’s give him a chance,” Mr. Roque said. “He has six months to prove his worth and let’s see if he will inspire people.” Rights groups say that extrajudicial killings tied to the drug war have continued despite the lockdowns this year, and in fact have gone unchecked as the country grapples with the health crisis. Cristina Palabay, head of the Philippine rights group Karapatan, said that under General Sinas there had been more drug-related killings as well as illegal arrests. The Philippines, a country of more than 100 million people where virus cases peaked in August, has had close to 400,000 infections, one of the highest totals in Southeast Asia. There have been 7,647 deaths, according to a New York Times database.","['mr', 'covid19', '61000', 'coronavirus', 'hospitalizations', 'virus', 'credit', 'york', 'officials', 'health', 'live', 'updates', 'vaccine', 'record', 'cases']"

If they have … [+1505 chars]","Now the researchers are planning to expand their study to monitor thousands of children and adults. Some have antibodies that can block the new coronavirus in lab tests. Others do not.

“If they have the pandemic strain, are they protected?” Dr. Kassiotis asked. Will they get sick, he wondered, or will the infection be all but undetectable?

Dr. Elledge and his colleagues at Harvard developed their own highly specific, sensitive and exhaustive antibody test, VirScan. It is able to detect a diverse collection of antibodies that are directed at any of more than 800 places on the new coronavirus, including the antibody that Dr. Kassiotis and his colleagues studied.

After examining blood taken from 190 people before the pandemic emerged, Dr. Elledge and his colleagues concluded that many already had antibodies, including the one targeting the base of the spike — presumably from infections with related coronaviruses that cause colds.

But while adults might get one or two colds a year, Dr. Elledge said, children may get up to a dozen. As a result, many develop floods of coronavirus antibodies that are present almost continuously; they may lessen cold symptoms, or even leave children with colds that are symptomless but still infectious.

While adults may not have detectable coronavirus antibodies, many may be able to quickly make antibodies if they are infected with a coronavirus.

In typical viral infections, the immune system pours out antibodies to fight the virus. When the infection is quelled, the antibodies, no longer needed, diminish in number. But the body is left with so-called memory cells that allow antibody production to soar rapidly if the virus tries to invade again.","['coronavirus', 'dr', 'colleagues', 'elledge', 'antibody', 'virus', 'antibodies', 'adults', 'pandemic', 'children']"

We have a vaccine! Best news since January 10,” tweeted Florian Krammer, a virologist and vaccinologist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine (who also happens to be a participant in the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine trial).

Everything You Need to Know About the Coronavirus Here's all the WIRED coverage in one place, from how to keep your children entertained to how this outbreak is affecting the economy.

But having a press release from a pharmaceutical company saying a vaccine works is very different from actually having a vaccine that works. Pfizer, and its German partner on the vaccine, BioNTech, have yet to release any data from their Phase III trial. The findings this week are based on the trial’s first interim analysis, conducted by an outside panel of experts after 94 of the 43,538 participants contracted the coronavirus. That analysis suggests that most of the people who became ill had received a placebo, instead of the vaccine. But it doesn’t say much beyond that. (More on why that matters, later.)

And logistically, there’s still a lot that has to happen before people who aren’t study subjects can start rolling up their sleeves. Pfizer researchers are now collecting at least two months’ worth of safety follow-up data. If those findings raise no red flags, the company could then apply for an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. Only then could execs start doling out the 50 million or so doses they expect to make by the end of the year, a process complicated by the fact that until it’s ready to be shot into someone’s arm, Pfizer’s vaccine needs to be kept at temperatures downwards of -80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is way colder than the usual vaccine cold chain. Completing the immunization also requires two doses given three weeks apart. Oh yeah, and states that at this moment are trying to do all the other things you have to do to prepare for such a complicated immunization push—hiring vaccinators, setting up digital registries, deciding who will get vaccine priority—are doing so without any extra money dedicated to the effort.

Those are a lot of caveats. But still, there’s reason to be hopeful. If the results hold up, a Covid-19 vaccine that’s 90 percent effective will have vastly exceeded the efficacy bar set by the FDA. That level of protection would put it up there with the measles shot, one of the most potent vaccines developed to date.

The arrival of an effective vaccine to fight SARS-CoV-2 less than a year after the novel coronavirus emerged would smash every record ever set by vaccine makers. “Historic isn’t even the right word,” says Larry Corey of the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. A renowned virologist, Corey has spent the last three decades leading the search for a vaccine against the virus that causes AIDS. He’s never seen an inoculation developed for a new bug in under five years, let alone one. “It’s never happened before, never, not even close,” he says. “It’s just an amazing accomplishment of science.”

And perhaps even more monumental is the kind of vaccine that Pfizer and BioNTech are bringing across the finish line. The active ingredient inside their shot is mRNA—mobile strings of genetic code that contain the blueprints for proteins. Cells use mRNA to get those specs out of hard DNA storage and into their protein-making factories. The mRNA inside Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine directs any cells it reaches to run a coronavirus spike-building program. The viral proteins these cells produce can’t infect any other cells, but they are foreign enough to trip the body’s defense systems. They also look enough like the real virus to train the immune system to recognize SARS-CoV-2, should its owner encounter the infectious virus in the future. Up until now, this technology has never been approved for use in people. A successful mRNA vaccine won’t just be a triumph over the new coronavirus, it’ll be a huge leap forward for the science of vaccine making.","['covid', 'coronavirus', 'virus', 'shot', 'effective', 'covid19', 'company', 'pfizer', 'big', 'vaccine', 'mrna', 'cells', 'deal', 'genetic']"

Scie… [+4261 chars]","In a 2017 study, researchers at Yale University School of Medicine found that mice housed at 10 percent relative humidity had a much harder time clearing the influenza virus from their respiratory tracts than mice housed in 50 percent relative humidity. Their mucosal flow slowed way down, as you can see in a stunning set of videos recently posted to Twitter by the study’s lead author, immunologist Akiko Iwasaki. Without a functioning mucociliary response, the virus successfully spread to the lungs of these mice at higher rates, and the animals got sicker than their counterparts that breathed more moist air.

Cold, dry air can also impair the second and third tiers of the body’s immune response. If a virus gets past the mucus river, its next aim is to find the cells that line the airway, known as epithelial cells, then get inside them and hijack their molecular machinery to make more copies of itself. From the moment that happens, it’s a race between how fast the virus can replicate and how fast the body can rally its defenses. When infected cells sense they’ve been compromised, they flip hundreds of genes on. Some of these encode the recipes for making weapons of molecular war—scissor-like enzymes for shredding the virus’s genetic code and net-like proteins that tether the virus to the cell’s membrane, preventing it from releasing clones of itself to infect other cells nearby. Some of the genes produce chemical distress signals known as interferons. These molecules recruit immune cells to come and join the fight, and their response is what creates inflammation and flu symptoms—coughing, fever, sore throat.

“Whether or not you get symptoms really depends on how far the virus gets on its quest,” says Ellen Foxman, an immunobiologist at Yale who did her postdoc in Iwasaki’s lab. She has studied how temperature affects this race between the immune system and viruses that cause the common cold. “Cold temperatures affect the speed at which the immune defenses get turned on. It slows them way down and gives the virus a huge advantage,” she says. Similar effects have been observed in mice housed at low humidity—in very dry conditions, their airway epithelial cells lost the ability to turn on those SOS signaling genes. But exactly how dry air affects the interferon response is still an area of active research.

In the world’s temperate zones, respiratory bugs ebb and surge with the seasons. Each year, influenza, rhinoviruses, and the endemic common cold-causing coronaviruses retreat as temperatures and humidity rise, only to come roaring back as summer turns to fall. These lab experiments help explain how low humidity is likely driving these seasonal swings. But very few scientists have been able to directly test how big an effect humidity can have on preventing infections among people in the real world. In fact, it’s only been done once.

In 2016, a group of researchers from the Mayo Clinic led by molecular biologist Chris Pierret worked with a local nursery school to install humidifiers in two of its four identically laid-out classrooms. They let them run from January through March, periodically swabbing samples in each classroom, and then tried to grow any viruses they found. During that period, the scientists didn’t find as much infectious virus in the humidified classrooms, and the students who spent time there called in sick with flu-like symptoms less often than the kids in the non-humidified classrooms.

Pierret got the idea from some of his work with InSciEd Out, a Mayo-affiliated nonprofit aimed at reforming science education to encourage doing research—not just memorizing facts and figures. One way the organization does that is to partner with schools and help their students and teachers conduct experiments with zebrafish, a model organism commonly studied by developmental biologists. A couple of years ago, one Minnesota school went all-in on the idea. Administrators installed fish tanks in classrooms and the school’s high-traffic computer lab. That winter turned out to be especially dry, which got to be a problem for maintaining all that new fish habitat. The dry air was sucking up moisture from wherever it could—including the newly acquired collection of aquaria. One of the teachers called Pierret to tell him how exhausted he was. “I’ve been doing nothing but filling fish tanks every day!” Pierret recalls him saying. It also turned out to be a bad year for respiratory infections. The majority of schools in the area reported higher-than-average student absenteeism due to flu symptoms. Only one school didn’t: The one with the fish tanks. “It really stood out,” says Pierret. “That was the hypothesis-driving event for us.” He and his colleagues went on to test that hypothesis in a local nursery school, publishing the results in the journal PLOS One.","['covid', 'virus', 'coming', 'winter', 'dry', 'humidifiers', 'fish', 'school', 'pierret', 'help', 'response', 'humidity', 'mice', 'cells', 'immune']"

Scrum-half Antoine Dupont is one of the French stars who could be released back to his club this weekend

France's opening Autumn Nations Cup match in Vannes on Sunday has been called off after a spate of coronavirus cases among opponents Fiji.

Fiji confirmed another positive test on Tuesday after six cases last week forced the cancellation of a warm-up match against Portugal.

Organisers says there have been another four cases ""affecting close contacts"".

Bristol back Semi Radradra is one of those to have tested positive, his agent confirmed to the Bristol Post. external-link

""This was a difficult and disappointing decision, but it was the only possible outcome following today's test results,"" said Ben Morel, chief executive of tournament organisers Six Nations Rugby.

Fiji's remaining three matches in the tournament could be at risk.

They are scheduled to play Italy on 21 November and Scotland seven days later, before a final-round game against Pool A opponents on 5 or 6 December.

England, Ireland, Wales and Georgia make up Pool A. The final round of games, on will pair off teams in the corresponding positions in each pool.

A Six Nations statement added that ""it is premature to have any views on the staging of this match [against Italy] prior to a further series of tests which are due to take place in the coming days"".

Earlier on Friday, France cancelled a scheduled media conference to announce their team for the match, citing ""exceptional circumstances"".

The effect of the virus has already been felt on this autumn's matches with England having to cancel a match against the Barbarians after several of the invitational side's players breached restrictions confining them to the team hotel.

Elon Musk has been tested for the novel coronavirus and received conflicting results, according to the tech mogul’s Twitter account. The 49 -year-old founder of SpaceX wrote that he was given a rapid covid-19 antigen test four times, with two tests coming back positive and two coming back negative on the same day. Musk, who wrote that he experienced the symptoms of a typical cold, previously said the covid-19 pandemic would be gone by April.

“Something extremely bogus is going on. Was tested for covid four times today. Two tests came back negative, two came back positive. Same machine, same test, same nurse. Rapid antigen test from BD,” Musk tweeted shortly after midnight ET.



BD most likely refers to New Jersey-based Becton Dickinson, a company that produces a common rapid test for covid-19. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned back in July that BD’s rapid tests are less reliable than PCR tests, with about 3% of BD’s rapid tests returning false positives. BD’s tests are commonly used in nursing homes, one of the communities most vulnerable to covid-19.

Musk, who has criticized covid-19 lockdown measures and openly flouted workplace safety protocols in California during the pandemic, wrote that he tested positive once, then negative twice, then positive again. BD did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Friday.

“Could this be why we’ve been seeing such a major spike?” a Twitter user asked Musk, referring to the frightening rise in covid cases throughout the U.S. that some conspiracy theorists believe is a hoax.

“If it’s happening to me, it’s happening to others. I’m getting PCR tests from separate labs. Results will take about 24 hours,” Musk responded.

The U.S. is experiencing the worst covid-19 outbreak in the world with virtually every corner of the country breaking records for coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. The U.S. identified 150,526 new cases and 1,104 deaths from covid-19 on Thursday, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Over 67,000 people are currently hospitalized with the disease. Both the daily case count and the number of people hospitalized on Thursday are new records for the country and the world. The U.S. has recorded 10.5 million cases and over 242,000 cases since the pandemic began.

Hospitals are being overwhelmed across the U.S. but especially in the Upper Midwest, with one intensive care patient in Michigan even recently being treated in a storage room. Many hospitals in North Dakota are at 100% capacity, and some patients are being transferred out of the hospital to senior care facilities to make room for the sickest patients. North Dakota is so desperate for health care workers that staff who test positive for the virus are being allowed to work if they’re asymptomatic. Notably, asymptomatic people are still able to spread the disease and there’s real concern for others in the hospital who haven’t contracted the virus yet.

Musk, arguably America’s dumbest smart person, has been something of a covid denialist on Twitter, constantly questioning the science of the pandemic and helping spread conspiracy theories to his nearly 40 million followers. On March 19, Musk tweeted that there would be “close to zero new cases” in the U.S., “by end of April.” And on April 29 Musk tweeted “FREE AMERICA NOW” in response to the relatively lax partial lockdowns in some states that were intended to curb the spread of the virus. As Dr. Anthony Fauci has explained, the U.S. never really locked down in the same way that other countries locked down.

Musk has also frequently agreed with pro-Trump covid denialists, including one woman known as Melissa Tate who wrote, “The scariest thing about this pandemic is not the virus itself, it’s seeing American so easily bow down & give up their blood bought freedom to corrupt politicians who promise them safety.” Musk replied “true.” Tate now appears to be spreading disinformation about the 2020 presidential campaign, insisting that President Trump actually won re-election. In fact, Joe Biden won by a healthy margin in several key battleground states to secure the Electoral College vote.

Musk elaborated on his symptoms early Friday, explaining that he had, “mild sniffles & cough & slight fever past few days.” But Musk seems to be on the mend, whether or not it turns out he has the disease.

But phones lit up across Los Angeles on Tuesday with a different emergency: Coronavirus cases were on the rise after months of remaining steady. The public safety alert, the first time a virus-related one had been sent to the city’s residents since March, urged those who had symptoms or suspected they had been exposed to head to a testing site.

California recorded its millionth known coronavirus case on Thursday, becoming the second state, after Texas, to reach the grim milestone. That came as public health officials across the country reported more than 160,000 new cases on Thursday, a single-day record.

Citing an alarming increase in cases, San Francisco this week banned indoor dining at restaurants and paused a plan to reopen schools. In Los Angeles, thousands of residents have flocked in recent weeks to the parking lot of Dodger Stadium, one of the largest testing sites in the nation. In Sacramento, the number of people hospitalized with the virus has doubled to 158 in the past two weeks. And in San Diego, where rising cases pushed the city to the most restrictive level of the state’s guidelines, indoor activities will be banned as of Saturday in churches, gyms, yoga studios and movie theaters.

And it's not over: Facilities are bracing for further shocks as coronavirus cases rise across the country.

Workers are already emotionally drained and exhausted after staffing the front lines — and putting themselves at significant risk — since March, when the pandemic took hold. And residents are suffering deeply from losing people they once saw on a daily basis, the disruption of routines and being cut off from friends and family.

In response, nursing homes and assisted living centers are holding memorials for people who've died, having chaplains and social workers help residents and staff, and bringing in hospice providers to offer grief counseling, among other strategies. More than 2 million vulnerable older adults live in these facilities.

Join Judith Graham for a Facebook Live event on grief and bereavement during the coronavirus pandemic on Monday, Nov. 16, at 1 p.m. ET. Submit questions in advance here .

""Everyone is aware that this is a stressful, traumatic time, with no end in sight, and there needs to be some sort of intervention,"" said Barbara Speedling, a long-term care consultant working on these issues with the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, an industry organization.

Connie Graham, 65, is corporate chaplain at Community Health Services of Georgia, which operates 56 nursing homes. For months, he's been holding socially distant prayer services in the homes' parking lots for residents and staff members.

""People want prayers for friends in the facilities who've passed away, for relatives and friends who've passed away, for the safety of their families, for the loss of visitation, for healing, for the strength and perseverance to hold on,"" Graham said.

Central Baptist Village, a Norridge, Illinois, nursing home, held a socially distanced, garden ceremony to honor a beloved nurse who died of Covid-19. ""Our social service director made a wonderful collage of photos and left Post-its so everyone could write a memory"" before delivering it to the nurse's wife, said Dawn Mondschein, the nursing home's chief executive officer.

""There's a steady level of anxiety, with spikes of frustration and depression,"" Mondschein said of staff and residents.

Central Baptist Village in Norridge, Illinois, held a socially distanced ceremony for one of its beloved nurses who died of Covid-19.

Vitas Healthcare, a hospice provider in 14 states and the District of Columbia, has created occasional ""virtual blessing services"" on Zoom for staff at nursing homes and assisted living centers. ""We thank them for their service and a chaplain gives words of encouragement,"" said Robin Fiorelli, Vitas' senior director of bereavement and volunteers.

Vitas has also been holding virtual memorials via Zoom to recognize residents who've died of Covid-19. ""A big part of that service is giving other residents an opportunity to share their memories and honor those they've lost,"" Fiorelli said.

On Dec. 6, Hospice Savannah is going one step further and planning an online broadcast of its annual national ""Tree of Light"" memorial , with grief counselors who will offer healing strategies. During the service, candles will be lit and a moment of silence observed in remembrance of people who've died.

""Grief has become an urgent mental health issue, and we hope this will help begin the healing process for people who haven't been able to participate in rituals or receive the comfort and support they'd normally have gotten prior to Covid-19,"" said Kathleen Benton, Hospice Savannah's president and chief executive officer.

But these and other attempts are hardly equal to the extent of anguish, which has only grown as the pandemic stretches on, fueling a mental health crisis in long-term care.

""There is a desperate need for psychological services,"" said Toni Miles, a professor at the University of Georgia's College of Public Health and an expert on grief and bereavement in long-term care settings. She's created two guides to help grieving staffers and residents and is distributing them digitally to more than 400 nursing homes and 1,000 assisted living centers in the state.

A recent survey by Altarum, a nonprofit research and consulting firm, highlights the hopelessness of many nursing home residents. The survey asked 365 people living in nursing homes about their experiences in July and August.

""I am completely isolated. I might as well be buried already,"" one resident wrote. ""There is no hope,"" another said. ""I feel like giving up. ... No emotional support nor mental health support is available to me,"" another complained.

Inadequate mental health services in nursing homes have been a problem for years. Instead of counseling, residents are typically given medications to ease symptoms of distress, said David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School who has published several studies on this topic.

The situation has worsened during the pandemic as psychologists and social workers have been unable to enter facilities that limited outsiders to minimize the risk of viral transmission.

""Several facilities didn't consider mental health professionals 'essential' health care providers, and many of us weren't able to get in,"" said Lisa Lind, president of Psychologists in Long-Term Care. Although some facilities switched to tele-mental health services, staff shortages have made those hard to arrange, she noted.

Fewer than half of nursing home staffers have health insurance, and those who do typically don't have ""minimal"" access to mental health services, Grabowski said. That's a problem because ""there's a real fragility right now on the part of the workforce.""

Colleen Frankenfield, president and chief executive officer of Lutheran Social Ministries of New Jersey, said what staffers need most of all is ""the ability to vent and to have someone comfort them."" She recalls a horrible day in April, when four residents died in less than 24 hours at her organization's continuing care retirement community in northern New Jersey, which includes an assisted living facility and a nursing home.

She felt like she was responsible for the residents who had died, like she had let them down. She just had to talk about what she was experiencing and cry it out.""

Although Lutheran Social Ministries has been free of Covid-19 since the end of April, ""our employees are tired — always on edge, always worried,"" Frankenfield said.

Today, Moderna announced that its coronavirus vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective. It’s the second vaccine candidate (after Pfizer’s, at 90%) to give us an early peek at their phase three results, and once again the news is good, but comes with caveats.

Which vaccine is this?

Moderna’s candidate, like Pfizer’s, is an mRNA vaccine. No mRNA vaccine has yet made it to market, so it was an open question whether this technology is good enough to make a vaccine that works in the real world and not just in the lab. I t’s good news that two different mRNA vaccine candidates both work. So far, the approach seems to be a success.

Both vaccines require two doses for full protection, b ut there’s one huge difference between the vaccines in terms of distribution: Pfizer’s vaccine needs to be kept at ultra-cold temperatures, while Moderna’s can be stored in an ordinary freezer. Moderna’s can also be kept at refrigerator temperature for a month after thawing, if needed.

What do and don’t we know?

So far, both companies have released minimal information about their vaccines. We don’t have full results, and in both cases the trials are not yet completed.

In the Moderna study, of 95 cases of COVID among trial participants, only five were in people who had gotten the vaccine. The other 90 were in the control arm, in which people get fake (“placebo”) shots that only contain saline. (Pfizer’s study had 94 cases, and calculated an efficacy of at least 90%).

Moderna gave a little bit more information than Pfizer, including that 11 cases of COVID were severe, and that all were in people who did not get the vaccine.

Like the other study, this one did not include people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, people who had previously been infected with the coronavirus, or people with some types of serious medical conditions.

Side effects were mild enough for the company to say the vaccine was “generally well tolerated,” with fatigue and muscle aches the most common serious side effects.

How close are we to actually getting a vaccine?

It’s still going to be a while. Moderna and Pfizer both expect to have enough data to apply for approval in the next few weeks, but that’s just the beginning of the process. The FDA will have to consider whether the vaccine has enough potential benefit to outweigh potential risks, and whether there is even enough information to make that decision. You can read more about the process for approval here.

Even if everything goes well, it will be months before most of us can consider getting the vaccine, as i t takes time to manufacture enough vaccine for everyone . The New York Times reports that Pfizer thinks they can have 50 million doses available by the end of the year, and Moderna thinks they’ll have 20 million. That means if vaccination starts in January, only a small number of people, likely high-risk workers, will be able to get those vaccines initially. For most of us at lower risk, mid-2021 is the earliest we can expect to line up.

A lot can still happen between now and then. Real-world effectiveness might be a lot less than these initial numbers; the safety profile might be worse; we may have trouble rolling out the vaccine to everybody who wants it; enough people might refuse it and keep us far from the levels of immunity that would be protective for our society as a whole.

But if these vaccines do pan out, this might be the only time we’ll have to go through a holiday season while coronavirus cases are spiking to record numbers. Next year might be better.","['theres', 'feel', 'vaccines', 'coronavirus', 'moderna', 'study', 'okay', 'data', 'information', 'good', 'pfizer', 'vaccine', 'actually', 'mrna', 'pfizers', 'hopeful', 'cases']"

The Trump administration’s pseudoscience advocate on the White House coronavirus task force, Dr. Scott Atlas, is urging the population of Michigan to, uh, stage some sort of rebellion in solidarity with the novel coronavirus.

On Sunday, Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced three weeks of new social distancing orders covering in-person schooling, dining, gym classes, organized sports, large venues, and more. These lockdowns are in response to a 113% surge in cases over the past two weeks across Michigan— bringing the total cases since the pandemic began to around 276,000.

Atlas’s response was to call for human auxiliaries to step up and lend the virus their support: “The only way this stops is if people rise up. You get what you accept. #FreedomMatters #StepUp”

A nti-lockdown demonstrations in the U.S. have included heavily armed militiamen and other far-right groups, particularly in Michigan. In followup tweets, Atlas added that he was referring to peace ful protests, and was “ NEVER was talking at all about violence.” Atlas rather suspiciously capitalized the word “never” three times for emphasis.

In October, a group of six coronavirus sympathizers were charged with plotting to storm Gov. Whitmer’s vacation home in western Michigan, kidnap her , and possibly put her through some sort of extrajudicial “ trial.” FBI investigators alleged the group of conspirators, who belonged to a militia organization, had discussed various methods such as the use of homemade explosives to “grab the bitch” and escape authorities, or simply murder her.

Whitner told CNN on Sunday evening that “w e know that the White House likes to single us out here in Michigan, me out in particular. I’m not going to be bullied into not following reputable scientists and medical professionals... People that actually have studied and are well respected worldwide on these issues, not the—not the individual that is doing the president’s bidding on this one.”

“It actually took my breath away, to tell you the truth,” Whitmer added in a separate interview with MSNBC on Monday. “We are in the midst of the worst weeks of this pandemic. We have been going through this for nine months and right now the numbers are as bad as they have been at any given time and so we have to take aggressive measures.”

Atlas is a neuroradiologist who has reportedly earned enmity from other members of the White House task force for pushing quack ideas like allowing enough of the population to become infected by the coronavirus to create “herd immunity” (an approach likely to cause mass death on an enormous scale .) He has also lied about the science behind mask wearing to create the false impression masks are useless against the virus, which conveniently aligns with the agenda of a White House committed to doing as little as possible to prevent the further spread of covid-19 . Atlas has no actual expertise in epidemiology or public health, at least beyond working as a fellow for the right-wing Hoover Institution think tank.

For anyone considering “ rising up” against Michigan health authorities, recall that your fellow attendees may be prime candidates for spreading the virus, so it might not be the best idea. Also, the coronavirus itself is not sentient and thus cannot reward you for your service.

On the plus side, early data appears to show that vaccines under development by Moderna and Pfizer may be more than 90% effective, although the companies have yet to release their findings and the results can’t be independently verified. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NBC on Monday the vaccines are “effective” and could begin distribution by the end of the year, but he was concerned the timetable could be delayed if the Trump administration continues to refuse to cooperate with President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team.","['whitmer', 'covid', 'virus', 'coronavirus', 'dr', 'vaccines', 'atlas', 'house', 'favorite', 'collaborate', 'white', 'adviser', 'really', 'michigan', 'doing', 'weeks', 'trumps']"

Pfizer may soon have a vaccine—but challenges lie ahead

Pfizer and BioNTech put out a press release this week announcing that its Covid-19 vaccine is more than 90 percent effective for participants who were definitely Covid-free before the trial started then developed symptomatic cases. So far, there have been no serious safety concerns. The first of its kind, this vaccine is made up of mRNA that helps the body make proteins that train the immune system to recognize SARS-CoV-2. Pfizer will likely have the safety data it needs to apply for FDA approval by the end of the month. If it’s greenlit, it will be the first mRNA vaccine cleared for use in humans. Moderna, which is also making an mRNA vaccine, is expected to release early data in the coming days as well.

Though an approved vaccine would be exciting, distributing the Pfizer shot comes with its share of logistical problems. It requires two doses and must be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit or -70 degrees Celcius in order to be effective, which will make distribution across the US—not to mention worldwide—difficult and complicated. Then there’s the fraught question of who should get it first. Regardless, inoculating the whole world will require more than Pfizer’s vaccine alone.

Biden plans his coronavirus response as a new outbreak hits the Trump administration

Earlier this week, Joe Biden announced the members of his coronavirus task force. The 13-member team of doctors and health experts will help the president-elect develop a plan for tackling the pandemic and work with governors to develop consistent messaging at the state and federal levels. Separately, he is also forming a special transition team for coordinating the Biden White House’s coronavirus response with other federal agencies. Yesterday Biden also joined Democratic legislators in demanding a new stimulus package before the end of 2020.

Meanwhile, yet another coronavirus outbreak has hit the White House, likely after a crowded party on election night. Mark Meadows, the president’s chief of staff, and campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski are among those who have tested positive. More than 130 Secret Service officers who protect the president and the White House have recently been ordered to isolate or quarantine as well.

As people migrate indoors, cases rise in record numbers

As winter approaches, the pandemic continues to accelerate at an alarming rate: It has been just over a week since cases in the US first topped 100,000, and yesterday there were more than 160,000. In response, governors in Ohio and Utah have instituted mask mandates, and those in Illinois, Maryland, and Washington have raised the possibility of reinstating stricter lockdowns. And with the holidays just a few weeks away, experts are emphasizing that there is no way to travel and gather with family that is completely risk-free.

Part of the problem is that people are more likely to gather indoors as the weather cools and daylight hours wane. New research found that crowded indoor venues may have accounted for eight in 10 new cases in the early months of the pandemic. How can we make our indoor spaces safer? Given that viruses have an easier time spreading through dry air, researchers are investigating whether humidifiers could help keep Covid-19 at bay inside. Questions about air quality and flow could create the opportunity to transform how we ventilate buildings for the better.

One Question

What is ‘proning,’ and does it help Covid-19 patients?

Proning, an emergency medical procedure, entails flipping people over onto their stomachs. Doing this allows gravity to pull fluid away from the back of the body and make more space for oxygen in the lungs. It’s also safer for health care workers trying to avoid getting sick. It hasn’t been the subject of much research or attention, in part because it’s so simple it almost seems a misnomer to call it a “medical procedure.” But it’s become much more widespread since the spring, and some experts say this could be part of the reason why we’re seeing fewer deaths even as cases rise.

Was this based on some brand-new evidence that the virus mutates like a gremlin, getting worse at night? You wouldn’t know it from Governor Andrew Cuomo’s announcement, which did not cite any research whatsoever that might justify this policy. The announcement did claim, however, that New York uses “more science than any state in the nation.”

I’ve seen this happen again and again since the start of the pandemic: a new, “science-based” Covid-19 measure is prescribed, but the science in support of it is either vague or missing altogether. Just last week, for example, I was working on a story about the latest research into quarantine procedures. The best data to this point suggests that an eight-day stretch of quarantine, combined with a Covid test, provides the same level of protection as the traditional 14-day quarantine. But then I saw New York state’s new policy: Some people who arrived from out of state are allowed to quarantine for just four days. I asked New York’s Department of Health how they’d come to this decision, and they sent me another statement from Cuomo, in which he said only that he’d “worked with global health experts” on the plan. A formal guidance from the state health department gave no research citations, either, but it did find space to boast about New York’s record of “strict adherence to data-driven, evidence-based protocols.”

This problem is hardly limited to one state. While reporting on that same quarantine story, I reached out to Alberta, Canada, which allows for an even riskier-seeming 48-hour period of quarantine for some travelers. What was the scientific basis for this policy? I never heard back. A lack of transparency has even shown up in guidance from the World Health Organization. Back in March, I emailed the headquarters in Geneva to ask how they felt so certain at the time that the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus was not “airborne.” The press office responded to my questions with a pair of unhelpful scientific documents. In that case, the decision to omit (or ignore) existing research—which suggested that other coronaviruses are likely to be spread by air—might well have been a deadly mistake.

Hiding the scientific basis for pandemic policies makes it harder for the public to evaluate what’s being done. That means there’s no good way to audit measures that may be poorly crafted or even dangerous. The risks could be even deeper, though. When health authorities present one rule after another without clear, science-based substantiation, their advice ends up seeming arbitrary and capricious. That erodes public trust and makes it harder to implement rules that do make sense—for this pandemic and any future public health matters. As Zeynep Tufekci observed in March, both the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention bungled the early messaging on masks by recommending they be used only by health workers. Perhaps if these agencies had been more forthright in citing the studies they were using to create this guidance, the about-face that followed would have seemed less arbitrary—and provided less fodder for masking skeptics later on.

Yet unsourced rules are everywhere in this pandemic. There was no way for the general public to know, at first, that the recommendation to stay 6 feet apart originated in part from a 3-foot rule determined by decades-old studies of card-game players, and that the recommended spacing had been doubled on the basis of research into the spread of the original SARS virus through airplane cabins. And what about the widespread rule that each child in school should be allotted 44 square feet of space? WIRED’s David Zweig traced that back to a consultant who’d found it in an education magazine, which in turn had bungled what was already a faulty calculation by an educational nonprofit. Some pandemic guidelines are even stranger and more mysterious. In an effort to stop people from going out unnecessarily and spreading Covid-19 as winter approached in the southern hemisphere, the South African government prevented the sale of open-toed shoes and shorts (unless they were intended to be worn over leggings), on the grounds that any trip to purchase such articles of clothing would be inessential. In a seemingly backward move, the city of Madrid has closed parks but allows some indoor dining to continue. Meanwhile, Canada’s chief medical officer recommended that people engaged in sexual activity wear masks.

Everything You Need to Know About the Coronavirus Here's all the WIRED coverage in one place, from how to keep your children entertained to how this outbreak is affecting the economy.

There is precedence for public health agencies to provide scientific backing for their advisories. The WHO and CDC do sometimes cite research studies in their guidance documents. The latter, for example, gives specific information on the science behind its hand-washing recommendations—including more than a dozen references to published research papers. The pandemic poses special challenges in this regard, given the unprecedented pace and volume of new research about the novel coronavirus. Even back in the spring, 4,000 new papers on the topic were being published every week; and scientists were said to be “drowning” in the flood of findings. A lot of that new research now appears online before being vetted by reviewers for a science journal. Some of the findings have not stood the test of time, and as the evidence changes, battles will continue to rage about which studies should be the ones that drive policy. But right now we’re not even privy to that debate.

There’s a crisis in transparency in our Covid guidelines, and it needs to be addressed. We live in a time when people scrutinize nutrition labels and worry about the conditions on the farm where their meat was raised. So show us the data and research that informs rules about the pandemic, however messy it might be. Let us see how the Covid-19 policy sausage is made.

It isn’t only for the holidays. For months now, I’ve watched various acquaintances and their families decide to break the rules of social distancing in accordance with this same and suspect rule of thumb: It’s totally OK to meet up for a weekend trip ... as long as everyone has gotten tested; it’s fine to get together for a barbecue, or a visit with Grandma … just as soon as everyone has gotten tested.

Let me put this as clearly as I can: As a means of eliminating risk in the midst of a pandemic, the everyone-has-gotten-tested method is utterly absurd.

It’s true that getting a positive result tells you some crucial information: It’s time to cancel all your plans and isolate until you’re past the point of infectiousness. A negative test, though, doesn’t guarantee that anyone is Covid-free, and it’s never license to let down your guard. You might, for instance, contract the virus in the interim between being tested and receiving your results, or between getting your results and seeing your friends and family. (The testing site itself could even be where that happens.) Even if you assume these tests are 100 percent accurate, they’ll only tell you what your status is at the specific time the test is done.

Of course, the tests are not 100 percent accurate. In practice, their error rates may be even higher than the chance that you’re infected in the first place. The probability that you’ll receive a wrong result on any medical test depends not just on the test’s innate accuracy but on your baseline risk. Even a very good test will turn out more false positives than real ones if you go in as someone who isn’t likely to have the disease. Conversely, getting a negative result won’t give you that much information you didn’t have before. It might only increase your confidence at the margins, say from 95 to 98 percent, that you’re not already sick.

Covid testing is important, as a rule—it’s how we can identify people who have the coronavirus so they can separate themselves and stop the chains of transmission. Where people are coming together repeatedly in shared spaces, as in schools and workplaces or on sports teams, frequent testing can reduce transmission and outbreaks—but only when it’s paired with a robust system for isolation and contact tracing. As I’ve written here previously, testing alone isn’t enough; for disease surveillance to make a difference, it must be used alongside behavioral interventions such as masking and social distancing. If you’re assuming that a negative test means you can give up on those behaviors—that you can safely gather for dinner at a grandparent’s house or spend a weekend in a cabin with your buddies—then you’re asking for trouble.

It’s a lesson demonstrated by our current president. White House staff thought that if you tested negative, you were totally clear to go about your life with no masks and no distancing, says A. Marm Kilpatrick, an infectious disease researcher at UC Santa Cruz. That’s how Donald Trump and at least three dozen of his associates ended up with the virus. The same faulty reasoning explains the Covid outbreak of 116 cases at a boys’ overnight summer school retreat in Wisconsin, which was traced back to a student who had received a negative test just days before attending the retreat. Students at the camp were high-school age, and the rules for taking part were reminiscent of Kim Kardashian’s island birthday party of the thousand memes: All attendees were required to quarantine for a week before traveling to the event, wear masks during travel, and show proof of a negative PCR test result no more than seven days before they arrived. Once there, counselors and students were not required to mask and mixed freely with one another … kind of like how people who have tested negative might behave at a family gathering for Thanksgiving.","['youre', 'covid', 'testing', 'getting', 'family', 'result', 'prethanksgiving', 'test', 'tested', 'wont', 'negative', 'tests', 'really', 'safe', 'isnt']"

Dr. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and expert on the covid-19 pandemic, warns U.S. hospitals have become so overwhelmed that people with coronavirus will soon be dying in ER waiting rooms. And he’s not talking about something that could happen six months from now. Dr. Osterholm says this nightmare scenario will start within a few weeks.

“You know, my worst fear is what we saw happen in other countries, where people were dying on the streets. People literally were dying in the waiting room of emergency rooms after spending ten hours just waiting to be seen. That’s going to start happening,” Osterholm said.

Dr. Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota , made the warning on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday. Osterholm, who recently became an advisor to President-elect Joe Biden’s coronavirus committee , warned that “a few more weeks of this level of activity” will create a situation where people will be dropping dead in ER waiting rooms.

The U.S. has identified over 11 million coronavirus cases and more than 246,000 deaths, with a startling rise in both cases and hospitalizations over the past week. The U.S. currently has over 68,000 people hospitalized with covid-19 and has recorded over 1 million new coronavirus cases in the past week alone.

Dr. Osterholm seemed optimistic that even though people would be dying, it might serve as a wake-up call for some Americans to get their act together and act more responsibly.

“The media will start reporting it and we will see the breadth and the depth of this tragedy,” Dr. Osterholm said on Sunday about people dying in waiting rooms.

“That, I hope, will not be the way that we finally decide to reduce our risk, this idea of swapping air. We’ve got to stop doing that. And so, I think it is the health care system’s breaking—literally breaking—that will unfortunately bring us to a sense of reality of what we must do in the short term.”

The problem with Osterholm’s theory, of course, is that he assumes some covid deniers—people who firmly believe the pandemic is little more than a hoax—will snap into reality about this pandemic after people start dying in waiting rooms. It’s hard to square that belief with the fact that Americans are already dying by the thousands every week, and there are still plenty of people who deny that it’s happening, driven largely my disinformation networks tied to President Donald Trump and his followers.

Strangely, Dr. Osterholm made it sound like people were only dying in waiting rooms in other parts of the world, but some Americans did die in hospital waiting rooms during the first wave of the pandemic . At least two people died in a Detroit ER hallway in early April according to CNN, and an untold number of others died in New York in late March, according to the New York Times.

Dr. Osterholm also didn’t mention that some people in small towns are already dying in hospitals that aren’t equipped to treat covid patients, waiting for hospital bed space in larger cities with ICU beds. At least six patients have died in one hospital system under that exact scenario according to USA Today. And at least one hospital in North Dakota has started sending patients to nursing homes because they simply don’t have room. Roughly one in thirteen people in North Dakota have tested positive for the coronavirus, the highest rate in the nation.

Dr. Osterholm isn’t the only one warning about the immediate future of America’s hospital system. Science journalist Ed Yong warns that the 1.5 million coronavirus cases that have been confirmed over the past two weeks haven’t yet shown up in hospital statistics.

Yong notes that there’s a 12-day lag for some of those people who tested positive to get bad enough to need hospitalization.

“Another way to think about these lags is that some of the people who are infected on Thanksgiving will enter the hospital in the middle of December, and the morgue around Christmas,” Yong tweeted on Sunday.

And all of that is to say nothing of the people who struggle with so-called “covid long haul” syndrome—the unexplained situation where people struggle with chronic fatigue and terrible symptoms for months, even if they only had a relatively “mild” case of covid-19. It’s not simply a binary sentence between life and death when it comes to the coronavirus. Even those who survive can struggle with horrific medical conditions for months.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, President Trump’s former FDA commissioner and a regular contributor to CBS News and CNBC , also has a new op-ed in the Wall Street Journal warning that the worst is yet to come, with perhaps 200,000 more covid-19 deaths in the U.S. by the end of January.

From the Wall Street Journal:

In previous waves, health-care workers from less-affected areas were deployed to New York and the South. It isn’t possible to send an army of health-care personnel into hot zones when the entire country is a hot zone. Another 15% of the U.S. population could be infected by the end of January, on top of the 15% that has already been infected. The genetic epidemiologist Trevor Bedford estimates that such a course could result in about 200,000 more deaths, assuming an improved infection fatality rate of about 0.45%.

Gottlieb argues that a coordinated national response is needed to get everyone on the same page, something that Dr. Olsterholm has also been begging for since the pandemic began. But President Trump, a man who still hasn’t conceded that he lost the presidential election, has done virtually nothing to stop the spread of this disease. In fact, he’s actively made it worse through his campaign rallies and the appointment of covid deniers to the White House Coronavirus Task Force.

Dr. Scott Atlas, Trump’s most trusted medical advisor, even tweeted a shocking tirade over the weekend where he seemed to be advocating for violence against Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, a woman who was the subject of an alleged kidnapping plot.

Atlas denied in a later tweet that he was advocating for violence, instead saying that his words could be about voting, but Trump goons are always walking right up to the line and daring people to cross it, all while maintaining some kind of plausible deniability. Also, voting is done you dumbass. It stopped on November 3. When you tell a bunch of armed people to “rise up” that’s rarely seen as a call for casting ballots.

Virtually everyone recognizes that Americans have no appetite for new lockdown measures, especially since the federal government is not providing any financial support for people to stay home. But that simply means a lot more people are going to get very sick, and some of them are going to die. Americans will have to wait for Biden to take control of the U.S. government on January 20 to have some semblance of real leadership, but the pandemic is likely to be at its absolute worst near the end of January.

A recent poll showed that 38% of Americans plan to have Thanksgiving gatherings of ten or more people later this month. If you’re in that 38%, please consider making other plans. As Dr. Osterholm repeatedly says on his podcast, think of this as our “ covid year.”

It might suck to not see your family members, but it’s really for everyone’s health and safety. If you spend Thanksgiving with a bunch of people you don’t normally live with, you’re likely to spend New Year’s Facetiming with them from the hospital. It’s simply not worth it. And if you really love your friends and family, you’ll promise to spend Thanksgiving 2021 with them after we hopefully get this thing under control.","['waiting', 'covid', 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'dr', 'pandemic', 'start', 'hospital', 'expert', 'rooms', 'according', 'dying', 'osterholm', 'americans', 'er']"

The country's Health Minister, Frank Vandenbroucke , wrote a letter to St. Nicholas on Thursday assuring him he was exempt from quarantine rules that might interfere with his festive trip.

On December 6 each year, Belgian children wake up and rush to see if St. Nicholas , or Sinterklaas, as he is known in Flemish-speaking parts of the country, has left presents for them.

In some parts of Belgium, tradition has it that St. Nicholas arrives by boat from Spain, and delivers gifts on the evening of December 5.

""As you know, dear St. Nicholas, Spain is in code red. According to the rules, you should therefore stay a few days in quarantine here when you arrive,"" Vandenbroucke wrote in a letter published in French language newspaper Le Soir.

""However, since we know that you have no time to lose, and that you need every hour to prepare gifts for each child, we have decided to make an exception,"" the minister wrote, noting that the 17-day boat trip from Spain would count as ""more than enough of a quarantine"" in this case.

Belgium has now recorded more than half a million cases of Covid-19, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, while Spain became the fourth European country to surpass 40,000 coronavirus deaths earlier this week.

The minister also added that St. Nicholas would be exempt from the country's curfew, but warned him to maintain social distancing and wear a mask when necessary as he delivered presents.

Vandenbroucke also used the letter to pay homage to Belgian children, who, he said, had ""been particularly brave this year.""

""Indeed, it is not easy every day: at school, everything has changed; at the moment, they can no longer see their friends, they can no longer indulge in their favorite hobbies. Really, really, it's not cheerful for them. Not to mention that they can't even go and be cuddled by grandpa and grandma to be consoled.

""But still, they hold on, dear St. Nicholas. Not only to protect themselves, but above all to protect others. During these two weeks of vacation, moms and dads are doing their best to take care of them even more, but this year they deserve your visit more than ever. Every child is a hero, and for once, you don't need to check in your big, wise notebook,"" he wrote.","['letter', 'covid', 'rules', 'nicholas', 'quarantine', 'tells', 'worry', 'exempt', 'minister', 'vandenbroucke', 'dont', 'wrote', 'st', 'nick', 'spain', 'santa', 'belgian']"

Cases are climbing exponentially. If you didn’t already know someone who’s had COVID, you will soon. And as a virus becomes more common, it also becomes more likely to infect people who were following precautions.

That’s partly because our safety measures aren’t perfect, but it’s also because this spring and summer didn’t prepare us, emotionally, for the world we’re living in this fall. So here are a few reminders of how you can get the coronavirus even when you’re doing your best to avoid it.

Your bubble is bigger than you think

If you’ve established a bubble with a few family members and close friends, you may think you’re safe to hang out with them indoors and be physically close without a mask. But how can you know those people are actually COVID-free?

Advertisement

In most cases, you don’t. Your bubble isn’t just those people; in a sense, it’s those people plus everyone with whom they’ve interacted closely. (This diagram illustrates the concept perfectly.) Once you start including people from multiple other households, your network of potential COVID-carrying connections expands to dozens or, more likely, hundreds of people.

It’s tempting to think that if you know somebody well, they should be in your bubble. But if somebody has a job where they interact with the public, or if their kid goes to in-person school, or if they sometimes hang out with a friend who isn’t as cautious as they are, there’s a big ol’ hole in that bubble. The number of people who actually have a bubble as safe as they think it is, is vanishingly small.

Rules don’t always protect you

If you’re doing everything “right,” how do you define that? In many cases, we do so by following guidelines: If you returned to gyms, hair salons, restaurants, and your own workplace when they reopened, you probably assumed that the precautions put in place were sufficient to protect people. After all, the people in charge made decisions that were supposed to protect us.

Advertisement

But those rules aren’t always enough to keep us safe. Often, they sacrificed safety in favor of other goals, like allowing businesses to reopen and political pressure on governors and other leaders to ease. A textbook example: the outbreak at an indoor cycling studio that complied with all the rules. The only problem was, the rules allowed people to exercise together in the same enclosed space for an hour at a time, with wearing masks. Of course people got sick.

No safety measure is perfect

Even when you’re vigilant about the size of your bubble, even when the people in charge have instituted reasonable rules, even when you’re doing your best, the coronavirus can still get through.

Advertisement

Another helpful illustration is the Swiss cheese model, where each layer reduces your risk. Distancing isn’t perfect, but it reduces your risk. Masks aren’t perfect, but they reduce your risk. Spending time outside isn’t perfect, but it reduces your risk.

Advertisement

The Swiss cheese model is a good thing: even if one of the layers of intervention is missing, the others can still protect you. Stacking precautions together protects you further, just like how you wear your seatbelt and keep your car’s brakes in working order and drive carefully.

But it also means that there’s no guarantee. Even with all the layers stacked together, each only reduces your risk; none totally eliminate it. You can do absolutely everything “right,” and still a few virus particles make their way through.

Advertisement

The numbers in your community matter more than any specific action you take

Because no precaution is perfect, it matters what’s going on around you. If it’s February and there’s only one person in your town who is COVID-positive, you’re unlikely to get the coronavirus with few or small precautions. Once there are a few dozen cases, the precautions become more important.

Advertisement

By the time the virus is running rampant in your area, it’s more likely to be able to overrun your precautions. Think about crafting with glitter: If you only bring out the glitter for a few minutes for one final touch on your project, you may be able to keep it contained, and you can vacuum up the stray bits you missed. But if your child went on a field trip to a glitter factory and swam in the stuff, there will be glitter in your sock drawer the next day, even if you do everything possible, starting with hosing her off before she comes into the house.

If you live in a place that was hard hit by the coronavirus, you’re probably familiar with this concept. But if you don’t personally know anybody who got COVID until recently, you basically taught yourself over the course of eight months that whatever precautions you’re taking were good enough. As cases rise, the balance of the risk/benefit equation shifts. And yes, you can get the coronavirus now even if you are following the precautions just as well as you did before.

Advertisement

Ultimately, this means that some people who followed every possible precaution will still get COVID-19. So will some people who did their best, but slipped up here and there—or who couldn’t avoid certain risks, like going to work. There’s no need for shame or stigma to follow a diagnosis, since that makes it harder for us to talk honestly with each other about it. Follow the precautions you can, and try not to see positive cases as personal failings. Sometimes we really are trying our best.","['theres', 'youre', 'covid', 'coronavirus', 'rules', 'risk', 'precautions', 'perfect', 'think', 'bubble', 'right', 'cases']"

Since March, people throughout the world have been living within at least two separate spheres of reality. One sphere is inhabited by those who have changed their daily habits in light of the global crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, their every action now dictated by a desire to keep themselves and others safe from a new and highly contagious virus that’s killed nearly 250,000 people in the United States and pushed the economy into the abyss.

Advertisement

In the other lives the people who view COVID differently. Perhaps they think pandemic safety precautions, like wearing masks, are tyrannical government overreach. Maybe they have a certain fatalistic indifference to cramming into crowded restaurants, or question the scientific consensus about vaccines and social distancing. They might even think the pandemic is a hoax dreamed up by Bill Gates as part of an effort to usher in a new world order.

If you’re someone who trusts mainstream science, it can be difficult to talk to friends, loved ones, or family members who fall into the latter camp. Maybe you fear for their safety (because they aren’t following health recommendations) or worry they are falling victim to conspiracy theories (if they subscribe to Facebook groups that push misinformation about vaccines).

Advertisement

If that’s the case, you may yet feel compelled to talk to this person about the pandemic and their role in it. Here are a few ways to approach this difficult conversation.

Try to be empathetic

This is easier said than done, especially given the apparent indifference this mindset shows for the carnage wrought by COVID. To save yourself some anguish, try to look at this person as someone you may be able to help, rather than someone who needs to be mercilessly reprimanded.

Advertisement

During a disagreement, people would rather be talked to than yelled at. While laboring to convince someone of an objective reality is maddening, especially when the stakes are so dire, you have to stay calm. Try to understand why this person feels the way they do and to listen to their concerns, however misguided they may be.



As Shuhan He, a physician at Harvard Massachusetts General Hospital’s Emergency Department told Lifehacker in March:



I think there is something to be said for listening to people and trying to hear their concerns. Look, I’m a doctor at a major hospital associated with Harvard University, one of the world’s leading institutions. My entire life is to speak in disclaimers, jargon and technicalities because we always want to be technically correct. But that stuff doesn’t work that well when it comes to changing regular people’s behaviors.

Advertisement

Approach them with seeming curiosity

A good way to get someone to speak candidly to you is to approach them with innocent curiosity. In this context, you’re probably not really curious about why they chose to attend an anti-lockdown rally, but it can’t hurt to frame it that way.

Advertisement

Studies have concluded that curiosity engenders mutual understanding. If you’re ultimately looking to get someone to listen to you, it’s best not to cast judgement in an overt, or even noticeable, way.

Validation in moderation

Don’t get me wrong, you don’t have to prop up someone’s conspiratorial thinking or cheer on their disregard for the safety of those around them. You’re trying to get this person to listen to an opposing point of view. If you validate what you can about their existing beliefs (within reason), it will work to your advantage.

Advertisement

For example, if your uncle thinks a state-ordered mask mandate is the harbinger of America’s descent into an anarcho-Marxist politburo, you can validate his concerns sparingly by saying, “I understand you have concerns about your civil liberties. Nobody wants to have their freedom taken away, including me.”

Have the conversation in a safe environment

There’s no need to have this conversation in front of an audience. It’s not something to hash out in front of the entire family during the Thanksgiving dinner you definitely shouldn’t be having next week.

Advertisement

Your attempt to appeal to this person could be viewed as disingenuous; you don’t want it to appear as if you are just trying to burn or humiliate them in front of the peanut gallery. If you think they are approachable enough to be talked to at all, sit down with them privately (preferably outside, where transmission risk is lower).

Hit them with the facts

Now we get to the part that you’ve been thinking about all along. Once you’ve cultivated enough trust, you have to firmly and calmly hammer home reality. Much of this might hinge on countering whatever fringe intel they’re bringing to the conversation through the citation of real facts and figures.

Advertisement

If you’re short on any of this info, just read the news. For starters, the Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University is one of the most heavily cited trackers of daily cases and deaths in the United States. Beyond that, there’s a large enough body of public knowledge about COVID out there that you really have everything you need to help this person at least begin to consider your perspective.

Masks do help lessen the spread, mouthwash won’t cure COVID, herd immunity isn’t a panacea, the coronavirus can be airborne, and so on and so forth. This is just a sampling of the points you can raise in a respectful way.

Advertisement

Understand it might not work

Unfortunately, all of your hard work and good-natured attempts to understand and communicate with the other person may not do any good. Many people are stubborn by nature, and considering the daily cavalcade of pandemic misinformation clogging up newsfeeds and airwaves all over the world, they might already be irrevocably siloed off into their own chosen reality. You can show them the door, but you can’t make them walk through it, etc.

Advertisement

You can, however, make the right choices for yourself and those in your immediate sphere. This will eventually end, as recent promising vaccine developments present a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. Until we get there, though, do your best to stay sane and focus on what you can control.","['youre', 'covid', 'denier', 'talk', 'pandemic', 'think', 'work', 'person', 'world', 'understand', 'reality', 'concerns']"

As Italy reinstates many COVID-19 restrictions, the country’s tech ecosystem is watching and waiting to see what the wider effects of the emergency will be. Italy’s ecosystem for tech venture capital and startups has been in development for years and has made decent strides in the last decade. Will the coronavirus stymie their efforts?

Put off by high taxes and paperwork in their home country, many Italian entrepreneurs moved to places like London in years past to startup. Indeed, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development and the Italian Trade & Investment Agency in London have even been known to fund Italian entrepreneurs abroad to help them gain more experience. There are an estimated 100,000 Italians already living in London, attracting the likes of Riccardo Zacconi, co-founder of King.com (maker of Candy Crush) and Simon Beckerman of social shopping app Depop.

Rome has more than 20 incubators/accelerators and many established VCs; because of its lower costs compared to other European cities, it’s become a major base for startups. However, while many startups exist in cities like Turin, Bologna, Naples and Rome, Milan is generally seen as a bigger ecosystem because of its mercantile culture and a significant share of VC funds.

The good news: VC funding in Italy has grown. In 2019, Italian startups attracted $850 million, compared to just €140 million in 2017, as the VC ecosystem became less insular and more international investors arrived. Milan tends to attract the lion’s share of VC funding — in 2019, startups located there received €311 million, according to NGP Capital. In 2019, about 300 deals were venture-backed.

Even so, Italy is still very much behind its European counterparts, which means founders tend to move their HQ to fundraise elsewhere, while keeping their comparatively cheaper workforce at home. Italy continues to have structural problems for startups: Credit is based on a company’s financial history, so loans are off-limits.

However, in June 2020, the Italian government sponsored a €1 billion investment program aimed at the native startup ecosystem, creating a new venture arm: CDP Venture Capital.

This has seven different funds under management, including a VC fund-of-funds, “Series A/B matching” funds and acceleration funds. It has also launched two different acceleration projects aimed at supporting SMEs and startups with mentoring, networking and support services.

Additionally, the Ministry of Economic Development launched an initiative called The Italian Startup Act that bundled previously passed legislation to incentivize the Italian ecosystem with tools like tax breaks on early-stage investments and R&D credits, plus a startup visa to attract talent.

Entrepreneurs still face plenty of red tape, however, which is tough enough for Italians, let alone outsiders who might consider relocating. And skeptical observers are concerned that some of the government-backed initiatives look like the government is trying to pick winners, which rarely ends well. Plus, there is controversy about how a €209 billion recovery fund from the European Union, earmarked for the country’s 11,000 startups, will be spent.

But the talent pool is increasing, with Italian universities attracting more overseas students with English-language-based courses and big corporates investing. Microsoft has announced a $1.5 billion investment plan, which includes its first cloud data center in the country. NTT data is investing in Calabria. Amazon has invested in new infrastructure. And Apple has sponsored a Naples-based developer academy.

With a population of 60 million (for comparison, U.K.: 66 million, Germany: 83 million, Spain: 46 million), Italy is not lacking in people, but GDP per capita is a low $34,000. It has an estimated 67 VC funds, with 18 of them started since 2015.

Notable startups from Italy include MoneyFarm (which has raised $127 million from United Ventures, Allianz), Prima.it (€100 million, Blackstone, Goldman Sachs), Soldo (€83 million, Accel, Battery Ventures), Casavo (€59 million, Greenoaks, Picus, Project A, 360 Capital), Musixmatch ($14M, P101) and Milkman (€32 million, p101, 360 Capital Partners).

Most recently, Satispay was backed by Square to the tune of £18m, while Spreaker was acquired by iHeartMedia.

Approximately half of seed to Series A funds have raised $100 million+ funds in the last year. However, seed rounds for startups remain low, even for Europe, ranging from anywhere from €300,000 to €1 million.

ScaleIT is a notable tech business event for the country (which clearly took over from the fabulous TechCrunch Italy events of a million years ago).

And finally, WeWork is opening two more buildings in Milan, taking it to five locations in the city, by mid-2021. Milan-born Talent Garden, which has raised €56 million, is still bullish about co-working despite the pandemic. While this was announced before news of a vaccine emerged, it’s clear that major players are still betting on Italy’s emerging tech ecosystem.

These are the investors we interviewed:

Giulia Giovannini, partner, United Ventures

What trends are you most excited about investing in, generally?

We are sector-agnostic in our approach, and we invest both in B2B and B2C tech/digital companies from various industries. We mainly invest in SaaS companies with some proven traction in the market – but overall, we seek the best technology entrepreneurs that want to make an impact. Our focus is on entrepreneurial and technological initiatives aimed at digitalizing and increasing the productivity of traditionally undigitized sectors. Lately, we have been looking into insurtech and medtech.

What’s your latest, most exciting investment?

In October 2020, we led a $7M Series A round in Boom Image Studio, a Milan-based company on a mission to reshuffle the world of commercial photography by transforming the way digital photo content is generated. We believe that Boom will significantly accelerate the photography industry’s digital transformation, dramatically improving the photo production experience for customers and photographers.

Are there startups that you wish you would see in the industry but don’t? What are some overlooked opportunities right now?

The strategy of venture capital is not to capitalize on the continuity of trends already existing on the market or to focus on the hype of the moment, but rather the exercise of imagining the demands of tomorrow, intercepting products and services capable of reinventing entire sectors with a view to a future industrial policy. Startups using tech to foster remote work, education, healthcare are undoubtedly in the spotlight at the moment: the key question is which technologies and platforms can meet current priorities and remain relevant in the post-pandemic future.

What are you looking for in your next investment, in general?

There is no such thing as a “typical United Ventures company,” but there is a paradigm that all our best investments have in common: ambitious founders with strong values and who know how to inspire their team, with an entrepreneurial project focused on a large growing market and the ability to scale internationally.

Which areas are either oversaturated or would be too hard to compete in at this point for a new startup? What other types of products/services are you wary or concerned about?

I have seen too many startups in payment services. I think the wave has passed.

How much are you focused on investing in your local ecosystem versus other startup hubs (or everywhere) in general? More than 50%? Less?

We are a European VC with a strong focus – approximately 50% – on the Italian ecosystem, where we are best placed to support teams in terms of value-add. We are committed to making the most of the Italian market’s peculiarities, connecting Italian entrepreneurs and talents to the global market. On a national level, we are active all around Italy, with startups headquartered in Milan, Rome, Bologna, Pisa.

Which industries in your city and region seem well-positioned to thrive, or not long-term? What are companies you are excited about (your portfolio or not), which founders?

Milan is well positioned on fintech matters, while Italy is home to many exciting initiatives very much oriented towards deep technologies thanks to research centers of excellence such as Milan and Turin Polytechnics and the IIT (Italian Institute of Technology). Concerning our portfolio, I am very excited by Credimi, a digital lending platform offering digital factoring solutions to enterprises experiencing significant growth rates, and I’m looking forward to working with Boom, our latest investment.

How should investors in other cities think about the overall investment climate and opportunities in your city?

The Italian ecosystem is still small compared to other European hubs, but it has been developing rapidly in recent years. Milan has earned a national hub’s status and reached that critical mass — of large companies, multinationals, universities with cosmopolitan vocation, new companies — capable of generating an ecosystem able to attract the best talents and connect them with other continental and global hubs.

Do you expect to see a surge in more founders coming from geographies outside major cities in the years to come, with startup hubs losing people due to the pandemic and lingering concerns, plus the attraction of remote work?

I think startups will continue to gravitate around big cities’ hubs because they bring value in terms of network and contamination. However, the pandemic has allowed an acceleration in the adoption of remote work organization, enabling the search and recruitment of talents from abroad. Many of our portfolio companies opened up fully-remote roles.

Which industry segments that you invest in look weaker or more exposed to potential shifts in consumer and business behavior because of COVID-19? What are the opportunities startups may be able to tap into during these unprecedented times?

B2C startups are certainly favored due to the increased penetration of e-commerce. On the other side, the adoption of new B2B business models may be slowed down by the modus operandi of large companies that are not at their ease signing remote commercial agreements, causing delays.

How has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy? What are the biggest worries of the founders in your portfolio? What is your advice to startups in your portfolio right now?

Our role, as Venture Capital investors, is to support our portfolio companies at our best capacity. Getting fundraising done and signing customer deals has been challenging in these months, so our advice is, first of all, to control and manage the cash carefully. We highlighted the need to communicate effectively and realistically with their employees, clients, and stakeholders. Concerning our investment strategy, we refocused on the Italian market.

Are you seeing “green shoots” regarding revenue growth, retention or other momentum in your portfolio as they adapt to the pandemic?

Tech startups are facing challenges and opportunities. Our portfolio is navigating the pandemic with determination and creativity. For example, Credimi has put in place several initiatives to aid Italian SMEs to face the COVID-19 emergency. More generally, B2C startups have seen significant growth in revenues, while B2B startups have, in some cases, seen a lengthening in the average time taken to underwrite commercial contracts.

What is a moment that has given you hope in the last month or so? This can be professional, personal or a mix of the two.

Having managed to close the investment in BOOM working remotely with the startup from the first meetings to the closing, I had the confirmation that our job can be easily managed through remote work.

The SpaceX CEO delivered another problematic Twitter thread this weekend, this time with a series of uninformed statements about the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. The billionaire questioned how it was possible that he had gotten two negative and two positive results from four rapid antigen tests.

Enter postdoctoral researcher Emma Bell who specializes in ""bioinformatics,"" which is basically analyzing biological data. Bell screen-shotted Musk's tweet, explained why he was so misguided, and then casually dropped the devastating nickname of the year: Space Karen.

Rapid antigen tests trade sensitivity for speed. They return a result in <30 minutes, but can only detect COVID-19 when you're absolutely riddled with it. What's bogus is that Space Karen didn't read up on the test before complaining to his millions of followers. pic.twitter.com/a1Snfpm03h — Emma Bell PhD (@emmabell42) November 14, 2020

Bell's tweet went viral, and it's easy to see why: The more you think about it, the more Musk is a total Space Karen.

Karens think and act in their own interest, without considering how calling the cops, complaining to the manager, or casting doubt on the veracity of science, might affect others. As Bell points out, it is Extremely Karen to call out ""something fishy"" to millions of followers, assuming your personal experience constitutes enough information to cast doubt on the best practices of scientists.

So yea, that's Elon. Plus space!

I will never not laugh at Space Karen https://t.co/InvR5sTRMy pic.twitter.com/92vQfIyzHi — dan hett (@danhett) November 16, 2020

In this case, Musk misunderstood that the fast 'n dirty option of the COVID-19 testing world isn't the most accurate. Many Twitter users broke this down for Musk, and Bell even wrote a helpful Medium post with a more in-depth explanation, noting:

Rapid antigen tests work by detecting a protein found on the surface of the virus. The greater the number of virus particles in your body, the more likely you are to detect it. The number of virus particles peaks as symptoms appear. In the days, even hours, either side of peak viral load, the likelihood of a false negative increases. COVID-19 is most contagious 2 days before symptoms emerge. Thus, a rapid antigen test may well return a false negative when an infected person most needs to isolate.

Bell may not have actually coined the term Space Karen, but they certainly used it with aplomb. One Twitter user attributed its origin to a tweet from a now-suspended account, but we haven't been able to confirm that.

I believe this is the original Space Karen tweet (that account seems to be suspended now though) pic.twitter.com/AfrvvxVIg0 — Dinis Correia (@diniscorreia) November 16, 2020

This isn't the first time Musk has spread misinformation about COVID-19. After repeatedly downplaying the threat of the coronavirus, he tweeted that children are ""essentially immune."" This is not true.

Musk's belief in his ability to know everything about everything is regrettable, to say the least. But at least we'll always have Space Karen.

I always thought the phrase 'won the Internet' was a bit daft, but that was before someone referred to Elton Musk as Space Karen. — cluedont (@cluedont) November 16, 2020","['karen', 'deserves', 'covid19', 'virus', 'bell', 'antigen', 'elon', 'test', 'musk', 'burn', 'tests', 'twitter', 'space', 'tweets']"

Fiji are in a group with France, Scotland and Italy in the Autumn Nations Cup

Fiji's Autumn Nations Cup match against Italy on Saturday has been cancelled after coronavirus tests found 29 positive cases in the Fijian camp.

It comes after their opener against France, due to be played last Sunday, was also called off.

Tournament organisers say they ""remain in constant contact with the Fijian squad to address the situation"".

""The potential impact on Fiji's remaining matches is currently under review,"" they added.

Fiji are due to play Scotland in their third and final Pool B match on 28 November.

They are then scheduled to play against a team from Pool A in the final round of fixtures on 5 or 6 December.

England, Ireland, Wales and Georgia make up Pool A. The final round of games will pair off teams in the corresponding positions in each pool.

Earlier on Tuesday, it was announced France had been awarded a 28-0 victory for the cancelled opener.","['round', 'coronavirus', 'cup', 'opener', 'nations', 'pool', 'france', 'final', 'scotland', 'called', 'play', 'italy', 'autumn', 'match', 'cases', 'fijiitaly']"

Normally, the process for getting back to exercise after you’re sick is a simple one: trust your body, take it easy, and don’t overthink it. But if you’ve had the coronavirus, extra caution is needed.

Athletes and recreational exercisers have ended up with lingering complications, including blood clots in the arteries and inflammation of the heart. Some athletes have also reported fatigue and respiratory problems that persist after they have otherwise recovered from COVID-19.

A team of doctors from the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York has published a set of guidelines for returning to exercise. (One of the authors, Jordan Metzl, has also written about the reasoning behind these guidelines in the New York Times.)

Advertisement

Among the recommendations:

If you think you only had a cold or flu, get tested for COVID-19 anyway, if possible.

If you have a heart or lung condition, consult a doctor before returning to exercise.

If you were healthy beforehand and had a mild case of the virus, you can consider returning to exercise after you’ve been symptom-free for seven days.

Expect to take about a month after that before returning to your full training schedule.

Stop exercising and see a doctor if your symptoms return, especially chest pain, fever, palpitations, or trouble breathing.

The concerns about returning to exercise mostly relate to cardio and conditioning activities. The recommendation to ramp up gradually suggests starting with just half of your normal volume of conditioning activities (so, if you are a runner, this might be half your normal amount of running). The guidelines aren’t specific about lifting weights, but the authors point to a set of non-COVID-specific guidelines that likewise recommends starting out easy when you return to the weight room and ramping up gradually.","['exercise', 'youve', 'covid19', 'normal', 'safely', 'york', 'heart', 'set', 'guidelines', 'returning', 'starting', 'return']"

England played three one-day internationals and three Twenty20s in South Africa in February

Three South Africa players are isolating before their upcoming limited-overs series at home to England following a positive coronavirus test.

Cricket South Africa (CSA) said there was one positive from about 50 tests.

Two players have been deemed 'close contacts' while all three players, currently unnamed, are asymptomatic.

England will play three Twenty20s and three one-day internationals, all behind closed doors, with the matches beginning on 27 November.

No replacements have been named in the South Africa squad but two new players will join the group before intra-squad warm-ups over the weekend.

England's players were tested before departure and again when they arrived at their team base in Cape Town on Wednesday.

The oldest member of the House was hospitalized with it.

Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, 87, on Tuesday became the latest lawmaker to be affected, announcing that he had tested positive. His absence helped to temporarily derail the confirmation of President Trump’s nominee for the Federal Reserve Board and shattered Mr. Grassley’s pride and joy, the longest consecutive voting streak in Senate history.

His diagnosis came the day after Representative Don Young of Alaska, also 87, disclosed that he had been hospitalized over the weekend after what he described as a particularly brutal bout with Covid-19. The twin announcements from two men whose gender and age put them at peak vulnerability to being killed by the virus underscored the risks that lawmakers are operating under as Congress continues to meet.

Having effectively declared themselves essential workers, the nation’s lawmakers — a group of older Americans whose jobs involve weekly flights, ample indoor contact and near-constant congregating in close quarters — are yet again struggling to adapt their legislative and ceremonial routines to stem the spread of the virus, even as it rages within their ranks.","['stall', 'virus', 'threatens', 'positive', 'hospitalized', 'grassley', 'tested', 'oldest', 'work', 'senate', 'tests', 'spread', 'congress', 'hill', 'republican', 'lawmakers']"

All while gasping for breath.”

“The reason I tweeted what I did is that it wasn’t one particular patient,” the nurse said. “It’s just a culmination of so many people, and their last, dying words are, ‘This can’t be happening, it’s not real.’ And when they should be spending time FaceTime-ing their families, they’re filled with anger and hatred, and it just made me really sad.”

These were astonishing statements, and, not surprisingly, they captured the attention of millions. Multiple US senators and Pulitzer-prize-winning journalists were among the throngs who tweeted out the CNN interview, which was also written up by The Washington Post and other mainstream outlets. “This is the cost of disinformation,” wrote Atul Gawande, a New Yorker contributor and member of Joe Biden’s coronavirus task force. Senator Elizabeth Warren called it “heartbreaking.”

There’s no doubt that we owe a deep debt of gratitude to Jodi Doering and all the frontline medical personnel dealing with the current surge in Covid cases. The work they do is truly heroic. Still, the manner in which Doering’s account of her experience has been reported and circulated should give people pause.

Doering’s statement that she’s watched “so many” people die from the disease even as they deny its very existence, endlessly repeated on social media and presented by news outlets without corroboration, would seem to represent a broader phenomenon.

But other nurses who work in similar settings say they’ve seen nothing of the kind.

I called a number of hospitals in the same part of South Dakota to ask emergency room nurses if they’d noticed the same, disturbing phenomenon. At Avera Weskota Memorial Hospital, about 20 minutes from Doering’s hometown of Woonsocket, an ER nurse told me, “I have not had that experience here.” At my request, Kim Rieger, the VP for communications and marketing at Huron Regional Medical Center, one of the four medical facilities where Doering works, spoke with several nurses at Huron to get their reactions to the CNN interview. None said they’d interacted with Covid patients who denied having the disease. “Most patients are grateful, and thankful for our help,” one told her. “I have not experienced this, nor have I been told of this experience, ever,” another said.

Read all of our coronavirus coverage here.

This in no way means that Doering’s account is untrue. But it provides, at minimum, some important context that was completely absent from the CNN interview and from all the media amplification that followed. Little or no effort was made to assess the scope of the problem that Doering so memorably described. How many Covid-19 patients in South Dakota are really so blinkered by disinformation that they're enraged at their caregivers and, in their final moments on earth, still dispute what’s happening? No one bothered to find out.

Alisyn Camerota, the CNN anchor who conducted the interview, is an Emmy Award–winning journalist. Tracy Connor, who covered the story for the Daily Beast, is that publication’s executive editor. They and others simply repeated Doering’s anecdotes, framed as an astounding embodiment of red-state denialism. The Washington Post article quotes at length from Doering’s tweets and TV interview, and claims—without providing any further evidence—that Covid patients seen by other health care workers “are reluctant to acknowledge that they have been infected with a virus that President Trump has said will simply disappear.” Similar write-ups appeared in the Daily Beast and HuffPost.","['die', 'covid', 'south', 'medical', 'real', 'cnn', 'patients', 'interview', 'doerings', 'gasping', 'told', 'isnt', 'doering', 'nurse', 'nurses']"

The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first rapid coronavirus test kit that can be performed at home, issuing an emergency use authorization to manufacturer Lucira Health late on Tuesday.

This does not mean anyone can just go online and order one of the kits whenever they please. Emergency use authorizations fast-track drugs and other medical supplies through the normally lengthy vetting process designed to ensure they are safe and effective, but they typically come with restrictions on in what circumstances they can be used. In this case, the FDA’s order allows for the kit to be made available to those ages 14 or older only with a valid prescription, and those younger can only receive the test if it is performed by healthcare workers. The order also allows for medical personnel to administer the test in a variety of healthcare settings ranging from doctors’ offices to emergency rooms.

At-home tests could help limit potential virus exposures in medical settings, increase testing rates, and relieve laboratories and test sites facing crushing demand. Mail-order kits already exist but have to be shipped back to a lab.

According to NPR, the kits are only expected to be available in limited quantities in Florida and California for now.

The Lucira COVID-19 All-In-One Test Kit is a molecular diagnostic test kit that can be used once and detects RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasal swab specimens. The swabs are inserted into a small electronic device that displays whether the result is positive or negative.

“While COVID-19 diagnostic tests have been authorized for at-home collection, this is the first that can be fully self-administered and provide results at home,” Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the FDA, told CNN in a statement. “...This new testing option is an important diagnostic advancement to address the pandemic and reduce the public burden of disease transmission.”

Lucira told NBC News its test is 94.1% sensitive and has a specificity rate of 98% . Sensitivity is a measurement of how often the test correctly generates a positive result, while specificity measures how likely a test is giving a correct negative result (the higher the rate, the less chance of a false positive) . For example, an airport metal detector is highly sensitive, but very non-specific, as it detects most metallic objects but provides no further information to the operator on whether it is a false alarm (loose change) or a real problem (a pistol).



Advertisement

According to the New York Times, Lucira’s test is less accurate than laboratory-performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which use reagents designed to make specific types of genetic material (such as viral RNA) duplicate themselves to detectable levels. The Lucira kit relies on loop mediated amplification reaction, a similar method that cuts some corners to generate speedier results. The Times also noted that Lucira’s study was small, self-conducted, and only involved participants exhibiting symptoms of the virus, meaning it hasn’t been vetted for use on asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals who only suspect they may have the virus.

Tom Bollyky, the Council on Foreign Relations’ director of global health and senior fellow for global health, economics, and development, told CNN that although some wariness is warranted, expanding the test kit roster available to healthcare workers and public health authorities is good news.

“The data is just still emerging,” Bollyky said. “Obviously with some past emergency use authorizations it pays to be cautious with what the FDA has put out here, but it’s certainly a promising sign.”

The U.S. has lagged to an embarrassing degree on testing since the start of the pandemic. The coronavirus is now considered to be spreading uncontrollably in the vast majority of the country, with the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine tracker estimating over 11.4 million confirmed cases and nearly 250,000 deaths. There are now very few places in the country where numbers of new cases are not increasing. As NPR noted, that means the U.S. is again struggling to meet demand for testing services, resulting in long lines and delayed test results.

There is good news, however. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced full results from a Phase III trial of its experimental covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday, with findings that suggested it could be 95 percent effective at preventing illness. Competitor Moderna released nearly identical results on Monday. Both companies are expected to seek emergency use authorizations from the FDA within days.

Though Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said the feds expect 40 million doses of the vaccine (enough for 20 million people, who will require two doses each) to be available in the U.S. by the end of the year, experts say it will take until mid-2021 at the absolute earliest to achieve herd immunity in the states.

Managers and supervisors at a Tyson Foods pork processing plant in Waterloo, Iowa, allegedly forced employees to work in unsafe conditions during the coronavirus pandemic and even took cash bets on how many workers would get sick from covid-19, according to new filings in a lawsuit brought against Tyson by the son of a worker who died. At least five workers from the Waterloo facility have died since the pandemic began and at least 20 Tyson workers have reportedly died of the coronavirus nationwide.

The lawsuit, which was uploaded in its entirety by KCCI Des Moines, was brought by the son of Isidro Fernandez, a worker at the pork plant who died of covid-19 on April 26. The suit alleges that supervisors, led by plant manager Tom Hart, organized a “cash buy-in, winner-take-all betting pool” on how many workers would test positive for the coronavirus.

One supervisor allegedly told employees that “it’s not a big deal; everyone is going to get it” and reportedly referred to covid-19 as a “glorified flu” when workers expressed concern. Covid-19 is more severe than the common flu and public health experts warn we still don’t know about the long term health effects in people who contract the disease but survive. So-called “long haulers” report months of sickness and fatigue after even mild initial cases of covid-19.

The new suit also claims workers were pressured to continue working, even after they were visibly sick in the Waterloo facility, the largest pork plant in the country. The Waterloo plant employs around 2,800 people.

“At least one worker at the facility vomited on the production line and management allowed him to continue working and return to work the next day,” the lawsuit reads.

The lawsuit says that managers directed their subordinates to ignore covid-19 symptoms in employees to make sure people continued coming into work (emphasis in the original):

Defendant John Casey explicitly directed supervisors to ignore symptoms of COVID-19. Mr. Casey told supervisors they had to show up to work, even if they were exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, and he directed supervisors to make their direct reports come to work, even if those direct reports were showing symptoms of COVID-19. On one occasion, Mr. Casey intercepted a sick supervisor en-route to get tested and ordered the supervisor to get back to work, adding, “we all have symptoms—you have a job to do.”

Tyson also incentivized sick workers to come in by offering a $500 “thank you bonus,” for anyone who didn’t miss a shift for three months. Most managers at the facility started avoiding the work floor of the pork plant out of fear they would get sick with covid-19, according to the lawsuit.

“Consequently, as the virus spread through the plant, the Supervisory Defendants and other managers increasingly delegated managerial authority and responsibilities to low-level supervisors with no management training or experience,” the lawsuit says.

A spokesperson for Tyson Foods declined to comment on the lawsuit early Thursday morning but told Gizmodo via email that the company is “saddened by the loss of any Tyson team member and sympathize with their families.” The spokesperson also said Tyson has “transformed” its meat processing facilities, “with protective measures including symptom screenings, face masks, workstation dividers and social distance monitors.”

Black Hawk County Sheriff Tony Thompson and local county health officials visited the pork processing plant on April 10 and lobbied to have the plant closed. A week later, Thompson was quoted in a local newspaper, the Des Moines Register, as saying that the plant should be shut down and get a deep clean. But Tyson continued to insist that it was doing everything it could to keep workers safe.

The lawsuit also alleges that Tyson didn’t provide workers with sufficient face coverings to help slow the spread of the virus within the plant. The dead worker’s son also says that his father was lied to repeatedly about both the presence of covid-19 at the facility and steps that were taken to ensure workers were safe.

Tyson installed temperature checks at its Waterloo facility around April 6, according to the lawsuit, but we now know such measures are woefully inadequate for detecting the virus, since fever isn’t necessarily present in all people who contract the virus. There were also reports at the time that some workers would take medications like Tylenol to reduce their fever to gain admittance, for fear of losing hours and pay. One worker who took Tylenol to get into work later died, according to the New York Times.

The lawsuit also alleges that Tyson successfully lobbied Congress, the White House, and the Iowa state government for liability protections. President Donald Trump ordered all meat packing plants to continue operation and declared a state of emergency in Iowa on March 24 to force meat processing plants to stay open.

The lawsuit also notes how Tyson was running ads in newspapers like the Washington Post and the New York Times about how keeping meat plants open was crucial to feeding America. Perversely, the lawsuit points to Tyson’s exports to China soaring 600% in the first quarter of the year. Tyson wasn’t just feeding America, it was making a lot of money exporting food to China while the first wave of the pandemic began.

The covid-19 pandemic has sickened over 11.5 million Americans and killed over 250,500, with states in the upper Midwest being particularly hard hit. Iowa has seen over 198,000 cases and 2,102 deaths since the pandemic began. At least 1,869 Americans died on Wednesday alone, according to the Covid Tracking Project.

Doctors on the White House Coronavirus Task Force reportedly warned Vice President Mike Pence this week that the U.S. could see a death toll of 2,000 Americans per day by Christmas. But with 1,869 Americans dying just yesterday alone, that number seems wildly optimistic. It’s not even Thanksgiving yet and hospitalizations are expected to rise after the national holiday.

Update, 7:58 a.m. ET: Updated with comment from Tyson Foods.

Update, 2:55 p.m. ET: Tyson Foods just sent Gizmodo the following statement about the case, noting that the company has now suspended the managers involved without pay.

“We are extremely upset about the accusations involving some of the leadership at our Waterloo plant. Tyson Foods is a family company with 139,000 team members and these allegations do not represent who we are, or our Core Values and Team Behaviors. We expect every team member at Tyson Foods to operate with the utmost integrity and care in everything we do. We have suspended, without pay, the individuals allegedly involved and have retained the law firm Covington & Burling LLP to conduct an independent investigation led by former Attorney General Eric Holder. If these claims are confirmed, we’ll take all measures necessary to root out and remove this disturbing behavior from our company.

Our top priority is and remains the health and safety of our team members. We’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars to transform our U.S. facilities, including the Waterloo plant, with protective measures, from walk-through temperature scanners and workstation dividers to social distance monitors and always-on testing.”","['facility', 'covid19', 'cash', 'bets', 'tyson', 'allegedly', 'managers', 'supervisors', 'lawsuit', 'workers', 'work', 'foods', 'plant', 'waterloo']"

But there was one thing he did not see coming: the conspiracy theories swirling around the coronavirus epidemic, and the fact that he would be at the center of many of them.

While giving an interview at the virtual health conference STAT Summit on Tuesday, Gates repeatedly skirted questions about how the anti-science messages of the Trump administration were affecting the coronavirus response. One question he did answer was whether he and America's reassuringly straight-talking grandpa — Dr. Anthony Fauci — ever commiserated about the prevalence of conspiracy theories. Especially those concerning, well, them.

Gates shared that he was taken aback.

""The idea of these conspiracies — What is the purpose of the vaccine? Is it microchipping, population control? — that was so unexpected that I don't think either Tony or I had great advice for each other, other than, hey, keep on giving that fact-based message,"" Gates said.

A new analysis of COVID-19 misinformation, based on a representative sample of 1,040 U.S. adults, found that 13 percent of Americans believe the conspiracy theory claiming ""Bill Gates is behind the coronavirus pandemic."" The report, published in the Harvard Kennedy School Misinformation Review, also found 25 percent believe that ""the coronavirus is being used to force a dangerous and unnecessary vaccine on Americans.""

Those numbers and the general rise of conspiracy theories are certainly depressing.

The eldest Trump spawn, Donald Trump Jr., has reportedly contracted the coronavirus. Honestly, given the rate at which the virus has spread among the president’s staff and associates in recent weeks, is anyone really surprised?

“Don tested positive at the start of the week and has been quarantining out at his cabin since the result,” a spokesperson for Trump Jr. said in a statement to CNN. “He’s been completely asymptomatic so far and is following all medically recommended COVID-19 guidelines.”

Bloomberg was the first to report his positive diagnosis on Friday after confirming the news with three sources familiar with the matter. Trump Jr. is the latest among more than four dozen people associated with the White House who have been infected by the virus, including President Donald Trump himself. Among others on t hat ever-growing list are first lady Melania Trump, the president’s youngest son Barron, his chief of staff Mark Meadows, longtime campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski, former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, and several White House aides and reporters.

On Friday, Andrew Giuliani, a White House aide and the son of the Trump’s campaign ooziest lawyer Rudy Giuliani, announced that he also contracted the virus. He said in a tweet that he was in quarantine and had been “experiencing mild symptoms.” One of Pence’s aides, Hannah McInnis, tested positive for the virus earlier this month, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke with Bloomberg.

Trump Jr. was one of the hundreds of maskless guests at a packed election night party at the White House, which is starting to look more and more like the administration’s second superspreader event in as many months. In October, Trump and several others tested positive for the virus following a Rose Garden ceremony to announce Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination. The nation’s leading infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci later dubbed the gathering a superspreader event, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he makes the same prognosis about Trump’s election night rally in the coming days.

Jhulan Banago feels it when he visits his mom's grave site every week and when he keeps putting out a plate of food for her at the dinner table every night.

Tiffany Olega felt it when she walked through the gates of Disneyland and collapsed to the ground, crying as she set foot in one of her mom's favorite places for the first time after her death.

Jollene Levid feels it every morning, when she combs through health-care workers' obituaries and keeps finding Filipino names. She sees her family in their faces -- so many senseless deaths.

""People always talk about it as numbers, but then when so many of the folks you know have died, and it wasn't because they weren't wearing a mask, it wasn't because they decided to eat at a restaurant. They were literally trying to keep someone alive and they caught it,"" Levid says.

""You have to ask, why is this happening to our community?"" she adds. ""There are so many factors, but I would assert that every death was preventable, which is what makes it so much harder.""

Rosary Castro-Olega had retired after a decades-long career as a nurse in Los Angeles. But she went back to work in March when she heard help was needed. Soon afterward, she contracted coronavirus. ""She was always there helping, no matter if she was feeling ill herself, or tired, or if she'd just finished a 12-hour shift,"" her daughter, Tiffany Olega, says.

Zenei Cortez, co-president of National Nurses United, says the news devastates her not just as a leader of the largest nurses' union in the United States, but as a Filipino American who knows firsthand how hard nurses are working on the front lines -- often without proper protection.

In a September report, the union found that 67 of the 213 registered nurses who'd died of Covid-19 and related complications in the United States were Filipino. Since then, Cortez says, the death toll has grown.

The union's latest analysis of nurses' deaths for which race and ethnicity data was available found that 74 of 245 nurses who'd died were Filipino, or roughly 30%. The toll includes nurses who were born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States, and Filipino American nurses born in the US.

""I'm very concerned and I'm very heartbroken,"" Cortez says, ""because these deaths are unnecessary.""

She's collecting data to honor the dead

Jollene Levid begins each day with a tragic task: searching news clippings to find the names of Filipino health care workers who've died. Her mission: working with a team of volunteers to confirm the details with multiple sources, then placing them on a website where they're compiling data and photos of those who've lost their lives in the pandemic.

The site is called Kanlungan , which means shelter or refuge. Levid describes it as a memorial. It's also, in a sense, a warning.

""We wanted to make sure that we were bringing dignity to people who have passed away saving others' lives. And we were hoping to collect data also, because people need dignity in the workplace now,"" she says. ""If nobody was collecting the information about how many have fallen to covid, we knew there would be no guarantee that the living would get the protection they need.""

Jollene Levid says the death of Rosary Castro-Olega, a close family friend who she knew as an aunt, inspired her to create a website memorializing healthcare workers who've died during the pandemic.

While many people featured on the site are nurses, she says, they aren't the only ones who are dying. The website also includes doctors, therapists and other medical workers of Philippine ancestry who've died in the United States, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, the Bahamas, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Guam and the Philippines.

""Three times as many Filipino health care workers have died here in the US than in the Philippines,"" she says. ""So right away we know that there's something wrong.""

They're piecing together what's happening -- and why

For decades, Filipino nurses have been on the front lines when health crises surged in the US and around the world.

""A number of them have worked in previous epidemics and pandemics in the United States, from AIDS to SARS to Ebola to Covid,"" says Catherine Ceniza Choy, a professor of ethnic studies at the University of California at Berkeley. ""So this is not a new phenomenon.""

Choy describes it as the latest chapter in a long and complex history that dates back more than a century. Her 2003 book, ""Empire of Care: Nursing and Migration in Filipino American History,"" traces the origins of the migration waves of Filipino nurses who came to work in the US back to the days of colonial rule in the early 20th century.

At that time, she says, an Americanized nursing curriculum was brought to the Philippines as part of efforts to build a new education system under the US policy known as ""benevolent assimilation.""

Decades later, when nursing shortages in the United States prompted hospitals to look abroad to help, she says, ""many American hospitals turned to the Philippines because they have similar professional nursing training and they have fluency in the English language."" And by the second half of the 20th century, more trained nurses came to the United States from the Philippines than from any other foreign country. Since the 1960s, Choy estimates more than 150,000 Filipino nurses have migrated to the US.

National Nurses United placed white clog shoes outside the US Capitol in July to honor nurses who lost their lives from COVID-19.

But still, Choy says, their contributions to health care here aren't often acknowledged. She hopes the pandemic may help change that -- and she's working with a team of researchers to better understand the disproportionate toll Covid-19 is taking on Filipino nurses. It's not just about data, she says.

""Behind those statistics are people who are trying to take care of you and me and who are trying to help us survive this pandemic,"" she says. ""The numbers are disturbing, and I would like to continue doing research about why that is.""

One possible factor, according to a research team she's working with: the places where Filipino nurses are more likely to work.

""The major finding...was that Philippine-trained nurses were disproportionately in the ICUs, the emergency rooms, in long-term care facilities such as nursing homes, compared to White, US-trained nurses. They were therefore much more exposed to Covid-19,"" says Jennifer Nazareno, the co-founder and co-director of the Philippine Health Initiative for Research, Service, and Training at Brown University's School of Public Health.

They're also more likely to live in multi-generational households, caring for more dependents. And often, she says, they're breadwinners supporting family members in the United States and the Philippines. That means they may be more likely to stay in high-stress jobs that put them more at risk.

And those may not be the only reasons why more Filipino nurses are dying.

The Filipino 'health paradox'

Another possible cause is what Nazareno calls the ""Filipino American health paradox."" On the one hand, she says, Filipinos and Filipino Americans are major providers of healthcare in the United States. On the other hand, they face significant chronic health disparities themselves , including being more likely to have diabetes or heart disease.

""That's what we're really looking to examine going forward,"" she says. ""Covid-19 has really revealed this even more, and has really centered this to look at these huge disparities that are happening to the Filipino workers who are now dying.""

JUST WATCHED Nurse: US hospitals are not ready for coronavirus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Nurse: US hospitals are not ready for coronavirus 05:16

Cortez, the president of National Nurses United, shared another theory with CNN. She says Filipino nurses are less likely to question authority and speak up even if, for example, they fear their employers aren't providing them with adequate protective equipment. That's especially true, she says, when they've come to the United States on work visas.

""A lot of them will not question authority so that they will not be at odds with their employer, because they're always afraid that one wrong move, the employer can revoke their work permit and send them back to the Philippines,"" she says.

As researchers continue to study the causes, the number of deaths keeps growing.

They're trying to keep their loved ones' memories alive

And for the families left behind, life is forever altered.

Tiffany Olega says memories of her mom frequently rush into her mind.

""It's been really difficult. ... Even the smallest thing will make me think of her -- driving by a Starbucks, anything with Lakers stuff, the thought of Disneyland,"" she says.

When Tiffany Olega graduated from college in May, her mom wasn't there to celebrate. Intead, her family posed with a framed photo of her. Rosary Castro-Olega, a nurse, died in March after contracting coronavirus.

Rosary Castro-Olega, a Filipina American who was born and raised in California, had already retired from a decades-long career as a nurse in Los Angeles. But when a cruise she'd been scheduled to take in March was canceled and she heard hospitals needed help, she had no doubt about where she was supposed to be.

Castro-Olega headed to work.

""She was always there helping, no matter if she was feeling ill herself or tired or if she just finished a 12-hour shift, she'd still go out to help somebody,"" says Tiffany Olega, her oldest daughter.

Due to coronavirus restrictions, only six people were able to attend Rosary Castro-Olega's viewing after she died.

When Castro-Olega died in March, she was the first health care professional to die of Covid-19 in Los Angeles County . And her name was the first added to the Kanlungan website.

This year, her grieving family celebrated her birthday at home without her. They wrote messages on purple balloons and lit candles as a memorial. Next year, they plan to celebrate it at Disneyland, wearing T-shirts with her photo beside a hashtag: #FallenHeroes.

Jhulan Banago says this photo of his mom, Celia Yap-Banago, always makes him laugh. ""I think it encompasses mom -- hardworking and joking. No one answers two phones and has two conversations at once. ... It's nice to see that mom was so happy at work.""

Since then, her family has kept fixing a plate for her at dinner and often turns the TV to her favorite channel -- The Hallmark Channel, which she'd watch as she drifted off to sleep.

""We want to make sure that if she's watching down on us, she knows that we miss her, and we still want her to be part of our lives, and also we remember her,"" Banago says.

Celia Yap-Banago, a nurse in Kansas City, died in April -- just days shy of her 40th anniversary at the hospital where she worked. Her family still leaves a plate for her at dinner every night.

Yap-Banago was the first person in her family to immigrate to the United States, and her death left relatives grieving across continents. Her son says she poured love into her patients, and into her family.

""To move to a new country on the other side of the world speaking a different language, to me that sounds extremely terrifying, but also I know why she did it. I know that she was very forward-thinking and...wanted to raise kids with more opportunity than she had,"" Banago says.

Banago says he takes comfort in a message an aunt in the Philippines recently sent him after a typhoon hit. While many homes nearby dealt with flooding and major damage, their house emerged virtually unscathed. The house was built with money his mom sent from the United States.

Even now, he says, his mom is still taking care of others -- forever a nurse.","['taking', 'american', 'family', 'covid19', 'care', 'filipino', 'toll', 'united', 'states', 'devastating', 'died', 'health', 'philippines', 'nurse', 'nurses']"

(CNN) Few measures in preventive medicine can compare with the impact of vaccines. In fact, the only human disease ever eradicated, smallpox, was wiped out with a vaccine. Given the major health burden caused by the novel coronavirus, having a safe and effective vaccine would be a critical tool in mitigating that burden.

Headlines as of late have painted a grim picture of the immediate public health landscape, with Covid-19 cases spiking across the nation and some cities and states forced to implement new regulations in an attempt to stymie the spread of disease. But amid the bad news, there has been a glimmer of hope. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that early data on their vaccine candidate showed it was more than 90% effective in trial participants, before announcing on Wednesday that a final analysis of the vaccine's Phase 3 trial found it was 95% effective. And on Monday, Moderna reported that early data from its vaccine candidate shows it is over 94% effective.

These promising news, however, are likely to raise some eyebrows, as they come along side skepticism that any Covid-19 vaccine developed on an expedited timeline may not be as thoroughly vetted as traditional vaccines. Emergency use authorization (EUA) can indeed be granted by the FDA to allow a vaccine to bypass some of the time-consuming approval processes that would delay its availability to the public. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla announced this week that the company is preparing to file for EUA on Friday

Some of this concern is warranted; it is critical that a vaccine is proved to be safe and effective before it is publicly available to assure it will reduce the disease burden and not cause undue harm. However, if a vaccine candidate is proved to be safe and beneficial to the public, it becomes imperative that it is widely administered.

So, what can be done now to instill public confidence in a vaccine if and when it proves to meet public health standards and scientific muster?

Transparency

Developing a vaccine and making it available for public use is a major undertaking. First, substantial preclinical work is needed to determine what is a likely protective immune response for the virus in question and then how to induce it. Once the preclinical work is done, three major stages of clinical trials traditionally follow before licensure is possible. By the time a vaccine makes it through these trials, thousands or even tens of thousands of volunteers may have received it and data on the clinical effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing the incidence of illness compared to a placebo typically provides proof of its efficacy. So far, both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccine trials have included tens of thousands of individuals , divided into groups of those receiving the vaccine and those getting a placebo.

But these companies may soon deviate from the traditional vaccine approval process by filing for an EUA from the US Food and Drug Administration to make their vaccines available to the public as soon as possible. Given this expedited timeline, the authorization process must be transparent and clearly communicated to the public to instill confidence that no shortcuts were taken that could result in harm to those who get vaccinated. To facilitate this, investments should be made in developing appropriate communications materials to help explain the vaccine trial and approval process to the public and to health care provider groups.

Committee meetings in a public forum

To ensure vaccine safety and provide an opportunity for the public to observe the data being discussed, vaccine trials should be reviewed by independent committees of experts in a public forum prior to vaccine approval and as administration programs are considered. Opportunities for public comments to the committees should also be prioritized. By doing this, concerned individuals will be able to hear firsthand the safety considerations that went into the critical decision making regarding the vaccine.

There are two major committees that need to be involved in this process: The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), which consists of experts in a variety of fields who can help in evaluating data to determine whether the vaccines should be approved for public use; and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which makes recommendations for vaccine use once the FDA has approved the vaccine. Information on the ACIP and the ability to listen and provide comments at meetings can be found online

The right message, the right messenger, the right communication channel

To be sure, there is still work to be done to make sure the current vaccine candidates meet US standards. There are many questions that are not yet answered by the early data made public. But the past weeks have been a major step in the right direction; we now have proof of principle -- that Covid-19 can be prevented by a vaccine. And the reported data suggest the vaccines are relatively safe.

Fortunately, there are many more vaccines in clinical trials, so we may eventually have choices of vaccines and assure supplies are available to vaccinate large proportions of the population to induce both individual and community protection. But at the end of the day, vaccines don't save lives. Vaccinations save lives. A vaccine dose that remains in the vial is 0% effective regardless of the results of the clinical trials.

Therefore, it is critical to assure the public that the vaccine benefits far exceed any risks. To do that, we need the right message, delivered by the right messenger through the right communications channel.

What is particularly important is that the messengers have the trust of the public. Whether it is Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx or any other health official who becomes a household name as we get closer to a vaccine's rollout, they must speak honestly in terms the public can understand, and deliver the message through trusted channels, such as national and local news outlets.

It will also be important for national health officials to provide critical information to primary care providers to help them in discussing risks and benefits with their patients, as these physicians are often the most trusted sources of information.

With rampant misinformation proliferating on social media, it is incumbent upon health officials at all levels to be intentional and transparent with the information they share about these vaccines. Only then, with the trust of the public and a widespread vaccination effort underway, can we embark upon the beginning of the end of the coronavirus pandemic.","['vaccines', 'covid19', 'public', 'effective', 'major', 'data', 'instill', 'critical', 'confidence', 'vaccine', 'right', 'opinion', 'health', 'trials']"

Even when lockdown restrictions began to ease in June, the researchers found, anxiety levels remained high and they said they expect that to continue this winter.

The researchers used information from Bristol's Children of the 90s health study in which 14,500 pregnant women were recruited in 1991 and 1992 in order to collect nearly three decades of health and lifestyle data about the mothers and their babies, who are now nearing 30.

Airbnb filed for an initial public offering… [+3147 chars]","Airbnb filed for an initial public offering on Monday, released its prospectus, and indicated it will trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol ABNB.

The prospectus gives a deep look at Airbnb’s business, particularly just how hard the platform has been hit by the coronavirus pandemic. As part of the filing, Airbnb says its business will continue to be affected by people scaling back travel as the virus continues to spread. Under risk factors, the company said the pandemic “and the impact of actions to mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic have materially adversely impacted and will continue to materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”

The company has seen annual net losses every year since its launch and says it may not be able to achieve profitability. It went from a net loss of $70 million in 2017 to a net loss of $674.3 million in 2019, on revenue of $4.81 billion. For the nine months ending on September 30th, it saw a net loss of $696.9 million on revenue of $2.52 billion, compared to a loss of $322.8 billion for the same period last year.

So far in 2020, Airbnb has sold $17.9 billion in gross bookings, a drop of 39 percent from the year prior.

“Our revenue growth rate has slowed, and we expect it to continue to slow in the future,” the company said.

Last quarter, Airbnb had revenues of $1.34 billion, down 19 percent from $1.65 billion in revenue in the year-ago quarter. But it reported $219 million in profit for the third quarter, as its business began to bounce back from the effects of the pandemic travel slowdown.

“In early 2020, as COVID-19 disrupted travel across the world, Airbnb’s business declined significantly,” according to the prospectus. “But within two months, our business model started to rebound even with limited international travel, demonstrating its resilience.” People wanted to get out of their homes, the company added, but didn’t want to stay in hotels. Its domestic travel rebounded quickly and was affected by the number of people opting to work remotely from an Airbnb rather than their homes.

“We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere,” the company said.

Airbnb had previously planned to go public in August even though it was in the midst of pandemic-related cancellations, which saw its valuation drop from its 2017 high of $31 billion to around $18 billion. In May, the company laid off about 25 percent of its staff or about 1,900 people. Executive salaries were also reduced for a temporary six-month span.

Also under its risk factors, the company noted that its business model relies on hosts, the homeowners who use the platform to rent their properties. “If we fail to retain existing hosts or add new hosts, or if hosts fail to provide high-quality stays and experiences, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected,” Airbnb said, adding that further decline or disruption in travel and hospitality or other economic downturn would “materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.”","['million', 'filing', 'coronavirus', 'travel', 'pandemic', 'materially', 'company', 'lost', 'airbnb', 'ipo', 'billion', 'net', 'revenue', 'millions', 'business', 'reveals']"

How a vaccine might be approved

There are three ways the public might get access to a vaccine. At an advisory panel meeting a few weeks ago, the FDA discussed all three. (While the CDC oversees the response to disease outbreaks, the FDA is responsible for approving drugs and vaccines.)

Full approval

First, there is the usual pathway a vaccine would go through: approval of a biologics license application, or BLA. The FDA has approved plenty of vaccines in its time, and guidelines for the process can be found here. Besides data from all three phases of clinical trials, the FDA also wants to inspect the facility that manufactures the vaccine.

The FDA also typically requires “phase 4” studies after the vaccine is approved, to obtain more information about safety and efficacy than what was known at the time of approval. These studies help to figure out whether there might be long-term side effects, or whether protection fades over time.

The FDA has laid out the specifics on what it’s looking for in a COVID-19 vaccine application in this document.

Whichever vaccine we get, it will probably go through this process sooner or later. But time is critical: the sooner we get a safe and effective vaccine, the more lives we can save. So regulators are considering two other pathways that could make the vaccine available sooner.

Emergency use authorization (EUA)

An EUA is sort of like a temporary approval, and can be given with just a fraction of the extensive red tape required for a full approval. It can also be rescinded if further research shows that the risks or harms outweigh benefits. For example, the FDA issued an EUA for hydroxychloroquine earlier in the pandemic, and then revoked it when the drug turned out not to be effective in widespread use. (Hydroxychloroquine was already approved, but the EUA allowed the drug to be deployed from the national stockpile for COVID-19 patients.)

The FDA released guidelines for vaccine manufacturers with their criteria for granting an EUA. Like the document mentioned above about approval, this represents the agency’s “current thinking” about what they’re looking for, but leaves room for them to change their mind as new information comes in.

Importantly, the FDA expects vaccine manufacturers to keep working toward full approval even if they get an EUA, and to continue any trials that are in progress. That raises an ethical issue, since potentially half the subjects in phase 3 trials have only gotten a placebo, not the actual vaccine. Should they be told they got the placebo, and allowed to get the newly-authorized vaccine? Or should they remain enrolled, so as to keep collecting placebo-controlled safety and efficacy data? In an FDA advisory committee meeting a few weeks ago, the panelists didn’t seem to come to a consensus on the best way to handle this dilemma.

Expanded access

Instead of a full or temporary approval, there’s another pathway to make drugs available: expanded access, sometimes called compassionate use. This is typically used when a patient is very sick, the treatment in question is not otherwise available, and there is no way to enroll them in a clinical trial. The potential benefits of the treatment still have to outweigh the potential risks.

It’s not clear if the FDA would consider a COVID-19 vaccine an appropriate candidate for expanded use, since it’s given to healthy people for prevention and not people with life threatening illnesses as a last resort.

But some ethicists are arguing that expanded access is appropriate because it would allow a small number of people who are at high risk to start receiving the vaccine, while placebo-controlled trials continue.

How the FDA will define ‘safe’ and ‘effective’

Regulators are already concerned that they are losing the public’s trust, especially now that the p resident has used the possibility of a vaccine as a political football—remember the orders to get vaccine sites ready by November 1, just before the election?

During that FDA meeting I mentioned, speaker after speaker expressed fears that even the name “Operation Warp Speed” might make people think that vaccine development is being rushed. They talked about balancing the need for a timely vaccine with the optics of rolling something out before it’s fully tested.

Trust isn’t just an issue from a vanity perspective—honestly, who cares if the FDA’s feelings are hurt? What’s important is that if people think a vaccine isn’t trustworthy, they won’t want to get it. And what good is a vaccine that nobody takes?

Fortunately, as I listened, I was reassured that there will be a decent amount of safety and efficacy data available before the vaccine is rolled out. According to the FDA, their requirements for an EUA will be similar to those for full approval. The difference will be in things like paperwork and factory inspections, not safety data.

The critical numbers, for either approval or an EUA, are these:

The vaccine’s effectiveness, as measured in a placebo-controlled trial, must be at least 50%.

Participants in the trial must have been followed for at least two months after vaccination, on average, to gather safety data.

For comparison, many childhood vaccines, like those for measles, have an efficacy of more than 90%. The flu shot ranges from 30% to 60% effective depending on the year. Preliminary results from Pfizer’s COVID vaccine trial appear to show that it’s 90% effective, which would be amazing if it holds true as more data comes in. (The nerd in me needs to insert a note here saying that efficacy and effectiveness are not exactly the same, but you get the idea.)

How we’ll find out if there are safety issues that occur after a vaccine becomes available

If the FDA only requires two months’ follow-up at the time of an EUA or approval, then there is no way to know whether the vaccines’ protection wanes over the course of many months or years. There is also no way to know if “adverse events,” or serious side effects, might occur further down the road.

Regulators are currently planning multiple ways of monitoring vaccine recipients for safety issues. First, the vaccine manufacturers will probably still be following up their study participants, and possibly enrolling people in further studies.

Second, there is already a system called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. Anyone can file a report if they think they were harmed by a vaccine. This is one way regulators and manufacturers can get an early heads-up that an issue might be popping up, even if it is uncommon and didn’t show up in trials. (Regulators sometimes refer to VAERS as a “hypothesis generating system” since the reports in it aren’t necessarily verified. In other words, they’re not proof that something is going on, but they can be a start in figuring that out.)

Next, there is a system called the Vaccine Data Link, which the CDC runs as a partnership with healthcare organizations. This data doesn’t cover as many people as VAERS, but it can be more reliable and it can also be updated very quickly in what the agency calls “rapid cycle analysis.” Like VAERS, this system has been used for other vaccines, including the HPV and flu vaccines.

The CDC is also planning a system called V-SAFE, which will involve reaching out to people who received the vaccine to ask, proactively, about how they are feeling. The first groups of people to receive the vaccine—up to about 20 million people—will get a daily text asking about symptoms during the first week, and then weekly texts until the six-week mark.

There are more plans, which you can read about here on the CDC website. Regulators are planning to comb through these data sources for the symptoms and complications they think are most likely to be of concern, collect further data about what is going on, and keep a close eye on whether the vaccine still meets safety and efficacy criteria.

Even with all of these precautions, there are a lot of unknowns, and i t’s entirely possible this whole process will be going on with four different vaccines at the same time, too. Whether the vaccine is seen as safe will depend on how everything plays out, but it’s good to know that the FDA and other government agencies are taking the safety considerations seriously.","['efficacy', 'eua', 'vaccines', 'approval', 'data', 'way', 'system', 'vaccine', 'approve', 'safety', 'fda']"

Workers that make Teslas during the coronavirus pandemic are now apparently considered “essential” in the state of California , which has reported an average of 10,981 new covid-19 infections per day in the last week. This means that Tesla’s workers will not be affected by the state’s new limited stay-at-home order, which goes into effect Saturday.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the new order on Thursday “in light of an unprecedented, rapid rise in covid-19 cases across California,” the governor’s office said in a press release. The order bans most non-essential work, movement and gatherings between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. for counties in the “purple tier,” or those the state considers to be at the highest risk for disease transmission. In these counties, many non-essential indoor businesses are closed.

This week, Newsom announced that 41 counties were now considered purple tier, which represent 94% of California’s population.

“The virus is spreading at a pace we haven’t seen since the start of this pandemic and the next several days and weeks will be critical to stop the surge. We are sounding the alarm,” Newsom said in a news statement. “It is crucial that we act to decrease transmission and slow hospitalizations before the death count surges.”

The order will remain in effect until Dec. 21.

While the stay-at-home order will apply to the majority of California’s residents, it will not apply to Tesla workers. CNBC reported on Friday that the California Department of Public Health classified Tesla employees as essential workers.

“The Limited Stay at Home Order does not apply to these employees as they are deemed essential workers - manufacturing is listed as an essential workforce. You can find more here,” the department wrote in response to a CNBC inquiry, linking to a state list of essential workers by sector. “The Critical Manufacturing Sector identifies several industries to serve as the core of the sector including Transportation Equipment Manufacturing Products. While operating, this sector must follow industry guidance for manufacturing.”

Per the website, the list of essential workers was last updated on Sept. 22. The state department of public health told the outlet that it had issued guidance in July that aimed “to support a safer lower risk environment for workers.” Nonetheless, CNBC found that the guidance had not been updated with any new requirements or precautions for factory workers.

That Tesla’s employees are suddenly considered “essential” workers is not exactly a surprise considering the ongoing fight between the company’s CEO, Elon Musk, and California officials, although it is an about-face.

Advertisement

In March, Alameda County officials told Musk that producing Teslas was not an essential service and that his Fremont, California factory had to maintain minimum operations during a state shelter in place order, which prompted a full-blown soap opera starring the CEO. Musk briefly shut down his factory, then reopened it again in violation of county rules and dared officials to arrest him. Shortly afterwards, he announced Tesla was suing the county and claimed to be planning to move the company’s headquarters and future programs to Texas or Nevada. County officials didn’t arrest him, of course, and then came back and said they had “agreed” to let the factory reopen. Tesla dropped the lawsuit against the county.

Back to the present: Now, it looks like California officials don’t want to go on the Elon roller coaster again, even if we are in a worse place than we were in the spring. While it’s clear that maintaining the economy is important, it’s really hard to see how letting thousands of employees go to work in Tesla’s factory is essential. It’s also flabbergasting, though not at all surprising, that Musk would want his employees to continue to going to work. Then again, this is the same person who has just tested positive for covid-19, the disease he said would be gone by April, and then raised doubts about the accuracy of testing.

Pfizer’s chief executive, Dr. Albert Boula, tweeted congratulations to Moderna.

But the companies announced the findings in news releases, not in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and did not disclose the detailed data that would allow outside experts to evaluate their claims. Therefore, the results cannot be considered conclusive. The figures on effectiveness may change as the studies continue.

The companies’ products open the door to an entirely new way of creating vaccines — and creating them fast. Both use a synthetic version of coronavirus genetic material, called messenger RNA or mRNA, to program a person’s cells to churn out many copies of a fragment of the virus. That fragment sets off alarms in the immune system and stimulates it to attack, should the real virus try to invade. Although a number of vaccines using this technology are in development for other infections and cancers, none have yet been approved or marketed.

“The fact that two different vaccines made by two different companies with two different kinds of structures, in a new messenger RNA concept, both worked so effectively confirms the concept once and for all that this is a viable strategy not only for Covid but for future infectious disease threats,” said Dr. Barry R. Bloom, a professor of public health at Harvard.

Natalie E. Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, said an important finding was that the vaccine appeared to prevent severe forms of the disease. Pfizer did not release information about disease severity when reporting its results.

Researchers say the positive results from Pfizer and Moderna bode well for other vaccines, because all of the candidates being tested aim at the same target — the so-called spike protein on the coronavirus that it uses to invade human cells.

Dr. Bloom said that the success of the two vaccines meant that measures of immunity used in earlier phases of the studies — participants’ antibody levels — were reliable, and that other companies could use those measures as proof of effectiveness to shorten the testing and approval process for their vaccines.","['studies', 'effective', 'coronavirus', 'vaccines', 'companies', 'virus', 'disease', 'data', '945', 'severe', 'modernas', 'vaccine', 'different', 'rna', 'results', 'early']"

Vanyo says her parents, two sisters, grandparents, uncle, aunt and cousins—and sometimes a boyfriend or two—get together for a big dinner and to share in each other’s company.

But the 21-year-old, who is originally from Texas but is currently attending college in Maryland, says she won’t be flying home this year. “We decided it’s not going to happen,” she says. None of them want to risk getting the family sick, especially Vanyo’s grandparents, who she says have been shut up in their home for safety reasons since the pandemic began.

“I’d much rather miss out on this year and have many, many years in the future,” she says.

It’s becoming an increasingly common question as the winter months approach: How do you safely handle the holidays during the pandemic? And it’s becoming increasingly more urgent as states experience a marked increase in cases.

Americans “may have to bite the bullet and sacrifice” Thanksgiving, warned Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, on CBS in October. He said his own Thanksgiving may look very different this year and warned people to be careful about social gatherings, calling gathering for holidays a risk. His own children, he said, won’t be returning for Thanksgiving.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has created a Thanksgiving section on its website, reminding people that staying home is the safest option but outlining varying levels of risk associated with traveling for the holidays—from the low-risk virtual dinner to the high risk of large gatherings with people not in your household.

Public health experts tell WIRED there is no completely safe way to hold a Thanksgiving gathering this year, but there are ways to reduce risk. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, says safety during the holidays depends on the individual and where they live, pointing out that many states are now facing higher prevalence of Covid-19.

Neil Sehgal, an assistant professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the University of Maryland, compares risks during the pandemic with risks associated with sex.

Abstinence-only approaches tend to be ineffective as people partake in behavior anyway, he says, but teaching people how to do so safely can reduce harm. And he understands people are itching to hold the holidays.

“We're social by nature,” Sehgal says. “The barriers to social gatherings are frustrating to us because they don't feel right. But for better or worse, we have to fight the urge” to fall back on old sociable habits, he says.

Crystal Watson, a senior scholar and assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees that people are frustrated with quarantine.

“I think we're all feeling really fatigued at this point and need as much social support as we can get,” she says.

It’s certainly how Alicia Burns-Wright feels about visiting home for the holidays. The 34-year-old from Washington, DC, says she values being able to spend time with her mom as they both get older. Burns-Wright is planning on visiting her in Philadelphia from Thanksgiving through New Year’s. But, as experts recommend, she’s taking serious precautions in the lead-up to her travel, strictly quarantining starting November 7, ahead of her November 21 trip.

Duke University School of Medicine professor Cameron Wolfe called it a “pre-quarantine” during a recent Duke University media briefing on holiday travel.

“If you know you’re going to have to travel and then come back, really try to think about the two weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, for example, as your pre-quarantine. Where you can minimize the risk of inadvertently bringing Covid to loved ones,” he says.","['thanksgiving', 'covid', 'holiday', 'risk', 'pandemic', 'reduce', 'gatherings', 'social', 'wont', 'professor', 'health', 'holidays', 'university', 'eliminate']"

The U.S. could see 2,000 Americans dying per day by Christmas if strict new mitigation strategies aren’t adopted, according to warnings from doctors on the White House Coronavirus Task Force and a new report from CBS News. The alarming news comes as the U.S. reports 1,565 deaths from covid-19 on Tuesday alone, with hospitals across the country becoming overwhelmed by the large volume of patients.

D octors on the White House task force recommend that all bars across the country be closed and that all restaurants stop providing indoor dining. CBS reports the unnamed doctors told Vice President Mike Pence that this could help slow the spread, though it’s not clear how well that message was received from the nation’s leaders . The White House has been criminally negligent during the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected over 11.3 million Americans and killed over 248,707, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University.

The doctors also told Pence that it would be helpful if he and President Donald Trump stressed “the importance of taking mitigation measures” through an address to the public in the White House press briefing room. That seems like an unlikely course of action, given the fact that President Trump hasn’t taken questions from the press since the November 3 presidential election and appears to spend most of his days tweeting about the election being “rigged.” Trump has still refused to concede the election, which he lost to Democratic challenger Joe Biden.

While many states are starting to introduce new measures, there are still at least 30 states where bars are open and indoor dining is allowed, according to the New York Times. At least ten states still have no requirement for residents to wear masks, including South Dakota, one of the worst hit states in the country. South Dakota has seen an average of 1,421 new cases every day for the past week. The state of just 880,000 people has recorded 644 deaths and more than 67,000 cases since the pandemic began earlier this year.

At least 76,830 Americans are currently hospitalized with covid-19, according to the Covid Tracking Project, a record that keeps getting broken with each passing day. At least 20 states set new records on Tuesday for hospitalizations, including hard-hit states in the Upper Midwest like Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana.

And hospitals are reaching a breaking point. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports that over 900 staff at the famed Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota have contracted covid-19 in the past two weeks. Hospitals from Texas to Michigan are operating near capacity, with no staff available to operate many of the ICU beds needed for patients who get seriously ill.

Numerous reports from the past week have also noted that health care workers are simply exhausted and don’t know how they’ll make it through the next couple of months both physically and emotionally. Some people are worried about the PTSD that will likely become evident after all of this is over, but doctors and nurses don’t even have time to worry about the longer term health effects. They’re simply living in the moment, working long shifts to keep their patients alive.

Incredibly, some people are still in denial about the deadliness of this pandemic, even when they’re literally on their deathbeds. And that travesty can be laid directly at the feet of the president. Trump spent months minimizing the threat of the pandemic, insisting that it would miraculously “go away.”

Advertisement

Covid-19 didn’t go away. And while we’re tremendously hopeful that new vaccines being developed by Pfizer and Moderna will reach people as soon as possible, there’s still going to be a lot of pain and death this winter before the pandemic is under control.

Don’t go visit family for Thanksgiving next week, even if your loved ones are disappointed in you . As coronavirus expert Dr. Michael Osterholm says, we need to look at 2020 as our “covid year” and promise our families that we’ll see them in 2021. That is, if you want to see them in 2021.

New research this week offers some hope for at least one aspect of our immunity to the coronavirus that causes covid-19. The study, conducted by researchers in the UK, found evidence that certain T cells created to combat the coronavirus during infection continue to show a “robust” response at least six months later. This cellular immune response is thought to play an important role in preventing reinfection or lessening the severity of a subsequent infection, alongside other components of our immunity like antibodies.

Advertisement

The new research is the work of the UK Coronavirus Immunology Consortium, a nationwide study backed by the UK government and involving several universities. As part of the project, the researchers have kept track of 100 volunteers who all tested positive for antibodies to the coronavirus sometime in March or April. Though some people developed symptoms at the time of their diagnosis, none needed hospitalization.

T cells are one of the main cells of the immune system. They carry out a wide assortment of duties during an infection, from directly trying to kill infected cells to helping other cells do their job better, including those that produce the proteins we call antibodies. Like antibodies, our body can produce T cells that specifically “remember” a past pathogen and are able to leap in action when it tries to reinfect us. Compared to studying how antibodies respond to a germ, though, a person’s cellular immune response is more complex and harder to measure. That makes this study one of the most important and largest of its kind.

The early results, released in a paper on the preprint website bioRxiv on Tuesday, certainly look encouraging. All of the volunteers appeared to develop T cells specific to the virus soon after diagnosis, the researchers found. And when the volunteers’ blood was studied six months later, these T cells seemed to remain in their system.

“To our knowledge, our study is the first in the world to show robust cellular immunity remains at six months after infection in individuals who experienced either mild/moderate or asymptomatic,” said Paul Moss, a hematologist at the University of Birmingham and one of the project’s lead scientists, in a statement released by the Consortium Tuesday.

Immunity to a disease like covid-19, as we have discussed before, is a complicated mess. Some research has suggested that coronavirus-specific antibodies can fade away in as little as three months, yet other research has suggested that the most important antibodies—those that directly prevent the virus from infecting new cells—can be sustained in most survivors for at least five months. And there are still other parts of the immune system relevant to covid-19 that haven’t been studied in much detail , such as memory B cells.

Experts do expect our natural immunity to the coronavirus to start waning eventually, simply based on our history with other coronaviruses that make us sick (how vaccine-induced immunity will work is still uncertain). But the findings from this new study and others suggest that some level of protection should endure for more than a few months. This protection may not necessarily prevent reinfection in all cases (indeed, we are starting to see scattered cases of reinfection reported throughout the world), but it will likely blunt the impact of a second infection if it does happen, experts have told Gizmodo.

There’s still a lot about our immune response to covid-19 left to be understood, and the findings from this study will provide new breadcrumbs for scientists to follow.

For instance, the study found that people who felt sick tended to have a stronger T-cell response than those who were asymptomatic, which could suggest that symptomatic survivors are better protected. People’s level of T-cell response over time also strongly correlated to their level of antibodies to the virus, while a larger T-cell response at the start was linked to a slower decline of antibodies. That likely means that any future vaccines will have to provoke a strong T-cell response in addition to an antibody response in order to be effective as possible.","['lasts', 'study', 'coronavirus', 'finds', 'covid19', 'immune', 'antibodies', 'months', 'response', 'infection', 'cells', 'immunity', 'kind']"

In the past few years, CityMD has colonized Brooklyn and Manhattan, often displacing beloved businesses that fell prey to rising rents. Now, suddenly, the whole enterprise seemed less like space filler. At another branch on Atlantic Avenue in Boerum Hill, the crowds were nearly as gargantuan. One couple had set themselves up in folding seats. By 10 on Tuesday morning, those toward the front of the line had been incrementally making their way forward since 6:45. In Manhattan, near Gramercy Park, the line for a CityMD on East 23rd Street was so long it nearly converged with a different one unfurling in front of Prohealth Urgent Care, on Third Avenue.

The problem with all this diligence, of taking space on a testing line for the prospect of enjoying pie and families-of-origin in Connecticut, is that anyone with an immediate and pressing need for a test result is left to wait that much longer. One man I met on the Atlantic Avenue line had been there for hours, hoping for the best after his son came home from school after being exposed to the virus.

No one from CityMD seemed to be outside prioritizing who should be let in sooner rather than later. A spokeswoman for the company told me that patients are triaged whenever possible, but that the demand for Covid-related visits and testing had never been higher.

It is hard to imagine a 25-year-old in, say, 1977, bearing all this sacrifice and discomfort for the purpose of sharing a meal with his family in November. As a child, I had an older cousin who consistently approached the holidays in the spirit of absenteeism. No matter what his job was in any given year, he always managed to work on Thanksgiving, something I regarded then as a sign of commitment but would later understand as a means of avoiding predictable disappointment and pain.

In this particular habit he was joined by many co-conspirators, especially and perhaps historically so in the 1970s, when the divide between parents and their grown children seemed vast and unconquerable. A generation of mothers and fathers lost to their vices and distractions had left their young feeding at an empty trough. So there was something distinctly hollow about gathering for an occasion grounded in a holy reverence for nourishment and gratitude.

But things are different now, obviously. The modern parent spends years clearing the path for children, who cling to them unremittingly. A pandemic was no longer a welcome excuse for retreating from obligation because obligation itself had been recast as longing. What once might have been viewed as opportunity — a free pass to skip familial duties — was now a reason for defiance. Against the advice of Dr. Fauci and the entire medical establishment, the kids were on their way home, and there was nothing to be done — over the river and through the obstacle course, assuming they hadn’t moved in already.","['testing', 'virus', 'morning', 'unexpected', 'revealed', 'citymd', 'nearly', 'long', 'way', 'manhattan', 'lost', 'message', 'space', 'line', 'lines', 'obligation']"

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has provided new guidance on how long people exposed to the coronavirus should quarantine away from others. Though the agency still recommends a 14-day quarantine period for people exposed to the coronavirus as the safest way to reduce the risk of further spread, it is now issuing two separate guidelines. Those exposed to the virus but who haven’t shown any symptoms may only need 10 days of quarantine, while those who have also tested negative for the virus can wait a minimum of seven days.

The changes reflect accumulating data that few people remain contagious beyond seven to 10 days, as well as concerns that people were often unable to comply with the previous 14-day rule.



Stirrings about these changes began gathering steam last week, according to reporting from the New York Times. Other countries, such as Germany, have also recently shortened or are planning to shorten their quarantine guidelines for travelers. The new CDC guidelines (not yet up on the CDC website) are meant to be more appealing alternatives to the still-recommended 14-day wait.

“We continue to refine our guidance to prevent transmission and protect Americans,” Henry Walke, the CDC’s covid-19 incident manager, said in a press briefing this week. “Reducing the length of quarantine may make it easier for people to follow critical public health action by reducing the economic hardship associated with a longer period, especially if they cannot work during that time.”

Aside from trying to get better compliance, though, there is growing evidence that people with covid-19 aren’t as contagious for as long as experts had originally feared. A recent review in the Lancet last month, for instance, summarized the current research and found that people with covid-19 tend to be most infectious from two days before symptoms start to about five days after symptom onset.

As both the Lancet authors and others have noted, there are likely exceptions to the above. People with severe covid-19 can have viral loads high enough to be contagious as long as 20 days into their illness. Those with weakened immune systems have also been found to carry relatively high levels of the virus for months, though it remains unclear how long these individuals would remain contagious. There have been isolated cases in which even symptomless people can test positive for the virus up to four months after diagnosis. In that scenario, though, it’s possible that these tests are only picking viral traces left behind, not live virus that can be transmissible to others.

The original 14-day guideline was largely based on our experiences with the SARS virus, a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes covid-19. But SARS-CoV-2 has many differences from the original SARS, such as being transmissible from people who don’t feel sick. So in this instance, it’s just a matter of scientists knowing more now about this new virus and how it works.

These changes appear to only address quarantine at this point, which refers to people strongly suspected of being exposed to covid-19. It’s unclear whether the CDC will change its recommendations for isolation, which is meant for people confirmed to have covid-19. Currently, the CDC recommends a minimum of 10 days isolation for these individuals. The CDC has not yet responded to a request for comment regarding these guidelines.","['relaxes', 'contagious', 'covid19', 'quarantine', 'virus', '14day', 'cdc', 'days', 'long', 'guidelines', 'exposed']"

Today, the coalition is issuing its 22nd monthly “10 Most Urgent” list of press freedom abuses around the world. This iteration focuses on cases relating to Covid-19.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has documented 207 pandemic-related press freedom violations globally, including imprisonment, physical attacks, legal threats, and harassment. Thousands of individuals and groups have called on the UN to release jailed journalists amid the ongoing health crisis. At least two journalists, David Romero of Honduras and Mohamed Monir of Egypt, died after being infected with the virus while in government custody. Azimjon Askarov died in prison in Kyrgyzstan from what his family suspects was Covid-19, though he was denied a test.

Here’s December's list, ranked in order of urgency:

1. Ahmet Altan (Turkey)

Senior journalist especially vulnerable to coronavirus in prison.

Ahmet Altan, 70, has spent more than 1,500 days behind bars and, according to his lawyer, is surrounded by three neighboring cells displaying Covid-19 positive signs. Former chief editor for the shuttered daily Taraf, Altan has been detained since September 2016. In 2018, a court sentenced Altan to life in prison, then in 2019 changed the term to 10.5 years. The retrial convicted him of “aiding a [terrorist] organization without being a member” during the failed attempted coup and sweeping purge in 2016.

2. Mahmoud Hussein Gomaa (Egypt)

Tactics prevent imprisoned Egyptian journalists from being released.

This December, Mohamed Hussein Gomaa will have spent four years behind bars—the longest pre-trial detention of any Egyptian journalist currently awaiting a hearing. Gomaa worked with Al-Jazeera, including contributing to a documentary about conscription in Egypt. Government officials arrested him in 2016 and called the material false with aims of “spreading chaos.” Gomaa was due to be released on probation in mid-2019, but his detention has been repeatedly extended. Fellow Egyptian journalist Mohamad Ibrahim is also enduring this “revolving door policy,” where new charges are brought to keep individuals in pre-trial detention, despite release orders from criminal court.

3. Mohammad Mosaed (Iran)

Tehran sentences journalist to prison to silence reporting on government.

Freelance journalist Mohammad Mosaed was arrested in 2019 because of a post on Twitter, then released in early 2020, only to be re-arrested in February and sentenced to nearly five years in prison. Mosaed has been charged with “colluding against national security” and “spreading propaganda against the system” because of a tweet he released during Iran’s internet shutdown last year and his government criticism this year, including its lacking preparedness in responding to Covid-19. His sentence also carries a two-year ban on journalism activities and a two-year ban from using all communications devices.

4. Solafa Magdy (Egypt)

Journalist enduring medical neglect and inhumane prison conditions.

Freelance reporter Solafa Magdy has suffered deliberate medical neglect and inhumane prison conditions, heightening her risk of contracting Covid-19 like fellow Egyptian journalist Mohamed Monir, who died from the coronavirus this summer while in pre-trial detention. Magdy was arrested in November 2019 for her coverage of immigration and human rights in Cairo. The state prosecutor’s office has filed additional charges against Magdy for actions she allegedly committed while in pre-trial detention.

5. Zhang Zhan (China)

Independent journalist imprisoned for coronavirus reporting, now on hunger strike.","['2020', 'covid19', 'gomaa', 'altan', 'free', 'journalists', 'spotlights', 'pretrial', 'magdy', 'egyptian', 'press', 'attack', 'prison', 'detention', 'journalist', 'coalition']"

The numbers are grim. More than 100,200 patients were in US hospitals Wednesday, according to the COVID Tracking Project

There were more than 2,670 deaths reported Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Those totals have never been higher. The stress on frontline health care workers has never been greater.

One county official in Wisconsin told CNN, ""Our hospital ICUs and emergency rooms remain stretched beyond any reasonable limit and our healthcare workers as well as our patients need our help.""

And the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday that these next three months will be ""the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation.""

After they are authorized by the federal government, coronavirus vaccines should help blunt the pandemic, but experts think it won't be until spring before a lot of Americans can get them.

Right now, the situation in places like Dane County, Wisconsin, are dire. Dane County Executive Joe Parisi, who told CNN resources are alarmingly stretched thin, said medical facilities are nearing capacity and this was the worst of the pandemic.

Dr. David Andes, who is a professor and chief of the Division of Infectious Disease within the Department of Medicine at the University of Wisconsin, said their hospitals are about 98% full.

""Our numbers are pretty out of control right now,"" he said.

Andes said hospitals are trying to work through the crisis by finding new places to care for Covid-19 patients. Some are being treated in a children's hospital. Some patients are being seen by doctors who are working outside their specialties. Many health care workers are signing up for extra shifts.

Other hospitals are facing similar demands. And while those facilities have been stretching capacity -- by opening up new areas, creating more double occupancy rooms and bringing in staff from outside its own system -- ""we are out of levers to pull,"" Dr. Jason Mitchell, chief medical officer of Presbyterian Healthcare Services in New Mexico, told CNN.

""When you run out of resources -- whether that's doctors or nurses or beds or ventilators -- you cannot give (the best) care. ... We are not there yet (but) we are very close as a state.""

Growing numbers will stress system, CDC chief says

The number of Covid-19 patients in US hospitals will stay high for months, the CDC's top official said Wednesday.

""The reality is, December and January and February are going to be rough times. I actually believe they're going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation, largely because of the stress that's going to be put on our health care system,"" said Dr. Robert Redfield.

Daily coronavirus cases and deaths also have been soaring.

The US has averaged 161,448 new cases daily over the last week -- nearly 2.5 times the summertime peak in July.

The country's daily average of Covid-19 deaths across a week is 1,531 -- above its summer high of around 1,130 but lower than the pandemic peak above 2,240 in late April.

But as coronavirus hospitalizations rise, the number of daily deaths is predicted to get worse, with various experts recently warning that it could regularly surpass 2,000 and 3,000, and perhaps approach 4,000

Health experts say they expect cases and hospitalizations to swell further in the coming weeks, when infections from Thanksgiving gatherings start to manifest.

And the CDC, like it did for Thanksgiving , is recommending that people postpone travel over the upcoming winter holidays, CDC Covid-19 incident manager Dr. Henry Walke said Wednesday.

100 million Americans could be vaccinated by February, Operation Warp Speed adviser says

The world appears to be moving closer to available Covid-19 vaccines: The United Kingdom on Wednesday became the first Western nation to approve one, and the first doses are expected to be rolled out across that country starting next week.

And two companies are preparing to ship out vaccines in the United States, anticipating the US Food and Drug Administration will give them emergency approval this month.

Vaccine candidates from Pfizer and Moderna are awaiting emergency use authorizations in the US, with an FDA panel expected to meet about whether to authorize them on December 10 and December 17, respectively.

By February, 100 million Americans could be vaccinated against coronavirus, Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, said Wednesday.

""All the investments we have made in scaling up and starting to stockpile manufacturing of the vaccines allow us to stay confident that we will be able to distribute 20 million vaccines, enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the US in December,"" Slaoui told a news briefing.

The United States has said if both Pfizer and Moderna win FDA emergency use authorization in December, they could distribute 40 million doses of vaccine by the end of the month. Each vaccine requires two doses, so that's enough to fully vaccinate 20 million people.

Slaoui said he expected 60 million more vaccines by the end of January.

CDC: 14-day quarantine can be trimmed to 7-10 days

New guidance from the CDC says quarantine periods can be shorter than 14 days for some people exposed to Covid-19.

CDC continues to recommend quarantining for 14 days as the best way to reduce the risk of spreading Covid-19, said Walke, the CDC Covid-19 incident manager.

But there are ""two acceptable alternative"" quarantine periods: Quarantine can end after 10 days without a Covid-19 test if the person reported no symptoms, or after seven days with a negative test result if the person has reported no symptoms. People who have been exposed should still watch for symptoms for 14 days, especially if they end quarantine earlier, Walke said.

""I want to stress that we are sharing these options with public health agencies across the country, so that they can determine how long quarantine period should last in their jurisdictions based on local conditions and needs,"" Walke said. ""Everyone should follow this specific guidance from their local public health authorities about how long they should quarantine.""

Reducing the length may make it easier for people to quarantine, Walke said, and lessen stress on the public health system as new infections are rising quickly.

States push back against climbing records

Tuesday was a record-breaking day for coronavirus devastation in many states, and local leaders are pushing back with new measures to combat the virus.

Oregon reported its highest number of deaths reported in a day. Texas set its record for coronavirus cases reported in one day, at more than 15,000. And Mississippi has more Covid-19 patients in hospitals than ever before, at more than 1,000, state officials said.

Mississippi since late October has had a mask mandate in certain counties where the spread of the virus was worst. The governor added 13 counties to that list -- meaning the mandate is now in 65% of the state's counties.

""This is a time when the virus is extremely present,"" Gov. Tate Reeves told reporters. ""The risk is higher of catching it because of the number of cases that we're reporting, there is more virus in the communities.""

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear called Tuesday the state's ""worst day ever"" for the coronavirus by ""virtually every measure.""

""It is the deadliest day that we have had,"" Beshear said. ""If we don't all do our part, if we try to be the exception, then slowing down this thing won't work, and we will lose a lot more Kentuckians we love and care about.""

California's Los Angeles County also had its ""worst day"" yet when it came to cases and hospitalizations, according to county Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer.

""However, it will likely not remain the worst day of the pandemic in Los Angeles County. That will be tomorrow, and the next day and the next as cases, hospitalizations and deaths increase,"" she said.

A modified stay-at-home order went into effect in the county Monday, prohibiting outdoor dining and gathering with people outside a single household.","['limit', 'million', 'hospitals', 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'quarantine', 'number', 'county', 'reported', '100000', 'deaths', 'patients', 'reaches', 'stretched', 'health', 'day', 'reasonable', 'cases']"

Hackers “assumed to be state agents” have been waging a phishing campaign against pharmaceutical firms and other institutions involved in the forthcoming distribution of a vaccine against the novel coronavirus, IBM announced on Thursday.

In a post on Security Intelligence releasing their findings, IBM Security X-Force researchers wrote that “precision targeting of executives and key global organizations hold the potential hallmarks of a nation-state tradecraft,” adding the unknown hackers likely sought to obtain “advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy.” The target, according to IBM, appears to be the “cold chain”—a term for the logistics network that allows vaccines and other drugs to be carried from point of manufacture to distribution in temperature-controlled shipping containers . What the attackers hoped to accomplish is unknown, with possible motives ranging from theft of technology to intel that could be used to undermine trust in the vaccine or disrupt distribution.

IBM researchers wrote that the individuals targeted firms in at least six countries and used tactics such as impersonating a Haier Biomedical executive to send spear-phishing emails and targeting the help and support pages of organizations. Many of the targets were linked to international vaccine alliance Gavi’s cold chain program and included European Union bodies key to vaccine distribution, UNICEF, companies that manufacture solar panels used in cold storage, and IT firms that protect pharmaceutical firms:

The targets included the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union, as well as organizations within the energy, manufacturing, website creation and software and internet security solutions sectors. These are global organizations headquartered in Germany, Italy, South Korea, Czech Republic, greater Europe and Taiwan.

The spear-phishing emails sent included malicious HTML files that prompted recipients to enter their login credentials, which would pass them on to the attackers. Pfizer and Moderna, the two pharma firms manufacturing vaccines expected to begin rollout shortly in the U.S., did not appear to be targeted, according to the New York Times. Nor are any other U.S. firms known to be targeted.



The most likely explanation is a nation-state because there is no clear “cash out” for cyber-criminals, the IBM researchers added in the release, other than the possibility that knowledge of vaccine shipping routes and safe storage requirements could be sold as a “hot black-market commodity.” It’s also possible hackers could be interested in using stolen credentials to launch ransomware attacks on computer-controlled shipping containers. According to the Washington Post, it’s not clear whether the hackers were successful at any of their phishing attempts.

“This activity took place in September, which means that someone’s looking to get ahead, looking to be where they need to be at the critical moment,” IBM Security X-Force senior cyber threat analyst Claire Zaboeva told Wired. “...

Per the Times, federal officials said the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will respond to IBM’s alert by notifying agencies involved in Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. effort to develop and distribute a vaccine. CISA coronavirus strategist Josh Corman told the Times there is a need for stepped-up “cybersecurity diligence at each step in the vaccine supply chain” and for institutions “involved in vaccine storage and transport to harden attack surfaces, particularly in cold storage operation.”","['distribution', 'covid19', 'ibm', 'cold', 'chain', 'times', 'target', 'vaccine', 'motives', 'security', 'firms', 'storage', 'used', 'remain', 'organizations', 'hackers', 'unknown']"

But Chan’s sample isn’t from a COVID-19 patient, and it doesn’t even contain the virus which causes the disease. Instead, she’s using a virus-like nanoparticle called a probe — essentially a fake coronavirus. Although they're only being used for research purposes at this stage, and were only made in the lab, these probes could serve a surprisingly essential purpose in the process of testing patients for COVID-19.

Dr. Chan, a nanoengineer at the University of California, San Diego, co-led research to produce these probes with Dr. Nicole Steinmetz, a nanoengineer and professor at UCSD who leads Chan’s lab. Their goal was to create something called a positive control. Scientists test positive controls alongside samples from patients so they can compare the two and ensure that the process of testing a patient sample for COVID-19 has worked correctly.

Scientists “need a positive control to show that everything is working so that the test result is reliable,” says Chan.

The gold standard of testing patients for COVID-19 is called a PCR test, which stands for polymerase chain reaction. PCR tests amplify genetic material extracted from a patient sample, which is usually a nasal swab or spit sample. After doing so, scientists can determine if the sample contains the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19.

Every time scientists test a patient sample, they need something to compare it to so that they know the PCR process is working correctly — say, a sample that will always test positive. That's where positive controls come in. If the control sample tests negative, scientists know right away that something about the process has gone wrong and the result of the test can't be trusted. Scientists also need positive controls when they're developing new tests to verify that a test works the way they expect.

Dr. Shangxin Yang, a clinical microbiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles who wasn't involved in the research, emphasized how important it is to have reliable positive controls. He says that critical shortages of these controls February severely limited COVID-19 testing, contributing to the out-of-control spread of the virus in March. Many of the positive controls used early on were actual virus samples from COVID-19 patients, which were uncommon in February and consequently almost impossible to get. Many labs simply did not have any positive controls, making them unable to perform tests, and those that could were quickly overwhelmed. Consequently, many people with the virus didn't know they had it and exposed the people around them.

But even when they're more readily available, the types of positive controls currently used in COVID-19 testing, which don't include probes like Chan's, have other drawbacks. One option is to use samples from patients, but that increases the risk that scientists doing the testing will become infected themselves. Scientists can also use fragments of genetic material that they make in the lab, which can't replicate and are too small to pose a risk of infection. But these need to be kept very cold or they'll break down. This makes the process expensive and poses logistical challenges to places with less resources. There are some positive control methods that don’t need to be kept cold. But because they are pre-prepared fragments of genetic material, they can't go through a process at the beginning of the test that extracts a fragment of genetic material from the sample. Because these kinds of positive controls can't be used during the extraction process, she says, scientists using them will never know if something went wrong during this early stage.

Since they're a different type of positive control, the probes would solve all of these problems, Chan says. The genetic material inside the probe won't disintegrate even when it isn’t kept cold, and the particle would also work as a control for every stage of PCR testing since it still contains relevant genetic material that can then be extracted in the early stages. Importantly, they don't have any live virus in them, so they don't run the risk of infecting scientists.

WATCH: How these filmmakers made a pandemic documentary during a pandemic

To make the probes, the researchers used two different methods. One method involved growing cowpeas, or black-eyed peas, and infecting them with cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV). Once the plants were grown and infected, Chan “harvested” the viruses, extracting them from the plant. Then, she removed all the virus’ genetic material and replaced it with coronavirus RNA. This results in the probe made of the plant virus and coronavirus RNA. In the study, the researchers also note the CCMV virus ""shells"" could be stored separately and the coronavirus RNA inside them could be inserted later. This enables the RNA to be slightly altered as needed and the probes to be used to test for several different strains of coronavirus, if new ones were to emerge.

The researchers also infected common Escherichia coli bacteria with an altered form of a virus called Qβ (“Q beta”) that they had inserted coronavirus RNA into. The E. coli reacted exactly as we do when we’re sick — it turned into a virus factory, producing countless copies of the Qβ virus. The viruses that the E. coli produced were ready-made probes — hidden among every Qβ virus’ genetic material was a fragment of coronavirus RNA. Both probes could go through the COVID-19 testing process exactly as a real virus would, and if all went well, would always test positive since they contain little bits of coronavirus in the form of RNA.

Researchers tested the probes’ durability by exposing them to room temperature for a month. As the lab is in San Diego, the probes were kept at a warmer room temperature of 20-25 degrees Celsius (68-77 degrees Fahrenheit). After a month, around 70% of the probes were still usable, confirming that they could be kept in room-temperature conditions for extended periods.

Yang says all this seems promising, if not new. In fact, Steinmetz and Chan started this research because Steinmetz's lab had developed similar probes for Ebola testing in 2016. Two pharmaceutical companies already manufacture related fake viruses for COVID-19 testing. While the new probes in the UCSD study aren't being used for testing, Yang says the new methods have the potential to be much cheaper and more efficient than the one these companies are using, particularly since E. coli are common, easy to produce a lot of in the lab, and efficient as copying viruses. But this study doesn’t provide any detailed plans for large-scale manufacturing of the probes outside of the UCSD lab — it only shows that the methods can work.

Still, Yang says there’s no reason the methods, particularly the highly efficient E. coli method, wouldn’t work on a massive scale. In fact, he says the technology could be critical not only in fighting this pandemic, but in helping address the next one. He says the U.S. should consider putting a system in place that allows for rapid manufacturing of positive controls as soon as a new virus is identified. That way, we can avoid the mistakes of this past February.

“This is something to me that is top priority,” he says.","['testing', 'coronavirus', 'virus', 'positive', 'probes', 'covid19', 'real', 'test', 'sample', 'help', 'genetic', 'thing', 'tackle', 'controls', 'fake', 'scientists']"

That fear is so great that the task force this week has told public health officials to take matters into their own hands if policies aren't stringent enough to match the moment.

""If state and local policies do not reflect the seriousness of the current situation, all public health officials must alert the state population directly,"" reports sent to each state dated November 29 said.

They also outlined behavior guidelines depending on age or risk factors, such as those older than 65 getting groceries and medicine delivered, because the risk is so high.

""If you are under 40, you need to assume you became infected during the Thanksgiving period if you gathered beyond your immediate household. Most likely, you will not have symptoms; however, you are dangerous to others and you must isolate away from anyone at increased risk for severe disease and get tested immediately,"" the reports said.

The task force expressed concerns and issued tailored recommendations to each state as they have since June.

North Dakota is again the state with the most new cases per population, followed by South Dakota, then Wyoming, New Mexico, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Indiana, Kansas and Montana in the top 10.

Idaho is the state with the highest test positivity rate, which can foreshadow surging cases and then hospitalizations and deaths, followed by Montana, then Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Utah, Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada and Indiana in the top 10.

The task force's comments calling on public health officials to directly alert the state's population if policy doesn't reflect the seriousness of the situation could have been directed at states like Missouri and Tennessee, where there are still no statewide mask mandates.

""The depth of viral spread across Missouri remains significant and without public health orders in place compelling Missourians to act differently, the spread will remain unyielding with significant impact on the healthcare system,"" the task force warned both states.

There are ""extraordinarily high rates of cases and test positivity in an ongoing health emergency"" in Wisconsin, the task force said, though it noted there had been a ""significant decline"" in new cases from the previous week. The report warned of ""minimal reserve capacity in the health care system"" there. It also suggested that clinical facilities ""have expansion and contingency plans.""

The task force called for ""more intensive restrictions"" in Wyoming, including increasing distancing through capacity restrictions at restaurants and bars, as well as ""enforceable requirements for face masks and social distancing."" Citizens who have been tested, the report said, should be given ""written and verbal education with instructions to isolate (and how to isolate) until results are returned and to continue isolation if results are positive.""

The Idaho report also suggested that ""further restrictions ... are warranted to reduce hospitalizations and deaths."" There is no statewide mask mandate in Idaho.

New Mexico, the state with the fourth highest new case rate in the country, has seen stability in new cases and decreasing test positivity rates over the last week, which, the task force said, could mean the state is ""achieving a high plateau and improving if a new surge doesn't occur post-Thanksgiving.""

There may also be a plateau in Arkansas, the state's report said, but warned that ""the percent of nursing homes with at least one positive staff member and positive residents is increasing, indicating virus spread is still broad.""

Hospitalizations, the report predicted, ""will continue in the coming weeks.""

The report for Arkansas also noted that testing trends ""should be cautiously interpreted this week given the number of individuals getting tested may have decreased due to Thanksgiving.""

In Delaware and Washington, the task force said it shared leaders' concern ""that the current situation is critical and that the population and health care system must do everything possible to prepare for and limit a post-Thanksgiving resurgence."" That, the report said, includes ""urgently needed"" improved public observance of social distancing to ""limit overrunning hospital capacity and additional preventable deaths,"" as well as limiting travel over the holiday season.

In California, the state's report ""saw a further major increase in reported cases, a large increase in hospitalizations, and a continued increase in deaths.""

""The current situation is critical after more than a month of continuing, rapid increases in cases and hospitalizations; the population and health care system must do everything possible to prepare for and limit a post-Thanksgiving resurgence,"" the report said.

The task force had similar concerns for Minnesota, where ""new hospitalizations fell slightly last week but remain extremely high,"" and ""large numbers of health care workers are unable to work due to infection with or exposure to"" the virus.

The Utah report praised the state for expanding testing, which it called a ""critical achievement,"" and its face mask requirement, which it called ""highly commendable,"" adding that the state should launch a ""holiday public messaging campaign.""

In Pennsylvania, where cases are also increasing, the task force expressed concern, ""especially given local hospital shortages and further increases anticipated over the upcoming holidays.""

The task force said Pennsylvania media platforms ""should be fully saturated with public health messaging on the risks of social gatherings, the clear recommendation to avoid such gatherings, the critical need for face coverings and social distancing, and instructions on how to report non-compliance of local businesses and organizations.""

Public health messaging, the report said, should employ ""champions from different political and cultural belief systems to convey the importance of mitigation efforts.""

Maryland, its report said, is ""showing signs of a continued viral surge,"" calling for some short-term mitigation measures, including restrictions on indoor dining.

The task force shared concerns with Vermont about spread in the state, though suggested that ""the modest proportion of Vermonters who, in a national survey, indicated plans to spend Thanksgiving with other households is encouraging.""

New cases in Hawaii are also concerning, the task force said.

""Given the need to protect the islands from the intensified epidemic on (the continental United States), the recently tightened requirements for tourists are warranted and should continue through the tourist season,"" the report said.

Hospital admissions in Alabama, its report said, ""remain elevated at an increased level.""

Reports for multiple states again called for proactive testing to identify asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals and again called for ""significant behavior change of all Americans.""

The reports also noted that universities should aggressively test students returning to campus after the Thanksgiving holiday, and make plans for weekly testing after winter break.","['state', 'rules', 'matters', 'public', 'tells', 'local', 'states', 'lax', 'population', 'officials', 'wh', 'report', 'health', 'force', 'week', 'cases', 'task']"

Every vaccine has its side effects, but most are mild and/or rare. If you’ve ever had a sore arm after a flu shot, or even a mild headache or fever, you’ve experienced these. The upcoming coronavirus vaccines will have side effects, too, and they might be a little more severe. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though.

No COVID vaccine has yet been approved in the U.S., but we’re getting closer. One of the top candidates, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, was just authorized for emergency use in the U.K. and could get a similar approval in the U.S. as early as next week. Another, from Moderna, is also under FDA consideration and could also be approved this month. (In both cases, the FDA will consider the safety and efficacy data and make a decision. There’s no guarantee a vaccine will be approved at all, but available information gives us reason to be hopeful.)

Fever and body aches may be common

Makers of both the top vaccine candidates have said that side effects from the vaccine are mild to moderate, which means (if that’s a complete and accurate statement) that they do not pose a serious safety risk. But mild and moderate side effects can still be uncomfortable.

According to the Pfizer vaccine’s UK label, the following side effects are very common, each affecting more than 10% of people who receive the vaccine: pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, and fever. (Note that it’s not necessarily common to have all of these, just that each one is common individually.)

Up to 1 in 10 people may have redness and swelling at the injection site, or experience nausea. And more rarely, people have reported swollen lymph nodes and “feeling unwell,” whatever that means exactly.

For an example of what this looks like, we can look to a few accounts from volunteers in the trials. One person in a vaccine trial—who doesn’t know for sure if she got the real vaccine or a placebo—told MarketWatch that her arm hurt after she got her injection, making her think she probably got the real vaccine. “The day after I got injected, I felt sluggish and tired, with body aches,” she said. “About three weeks later, I received a second injection. Again, my arm felt sore, looked red at the injection site and I had body aches and fatigue.”

At a recent CDC advisory committee meeting, panelists discussed the importance of people understanding that these side effects can happen. You might end up taking a day off from work if you feel crappy, for example. Hospitals and essential businesses may need to account for this fact and, for example, probably shouldn’t vaccinate their entire ICU staff all at the same ti me.

Side effects mean it’s working

While it might be annoying to experience these symptoms, they’re not a sign of a problem. Vaccines work by spurring our immune systems to react to the faux invader. Fevers, tiredness, and muscle aches are part of our own bodies’ response to an infection, and a mini version of that response often accompanies a vaccine.

COVID is a severe enough disease that the annoyance of these symptoms is, for most of us, well worth the potential benefit of being protected from a severe infection. But if the vaccine is approved and you decide to get it, it’s important to be aware of the possible effects.

Advertisement

Public health experts are afraid that people who experience fevers or tiredness after their first dose might not want to come back for the second. That’s important because most of the vaccine candidates require two doses for full protection. The UK label for the Pfizer vaccine notes that you shouldn’t consider yourself protected until seven days after the second shot. Since the two doses are given at least three weeks apart, this means your protection won’t begin until a month after the first one.

We’ll probably find out more about the vaccines and their side effects around the time of their respective FDA meetings—Dec. 10 for Pfizer and Dec. 17 for Moderna.

But the Biden transition team confirmed to The Verge that Zients liquidated his Facebook stock earlier this year and will retain no equity when he officially begins his White House role.

Zients joined the Facebook board in May 2018 in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal but declined to seek reelection to the board when his term ended in 2020. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show he was compensated with $100,000 in cash and just over $300,000 in stock awards for his work chairing the board’s Audit & Risk Oversight Committee, which met 13 times in 2019. Crucially, the last of his restricted stock units were vested in May 2020, leaving him able to entirely liquidate his financial ties to the company.

“Facebook must be held accountable for amplifying misinformation.”

Zients’ departure from the Facebook board was abrupt and came amid rumors of a split with the company’s management. “Mr. Zients was generally aligned with Kenneth Chenault, [who] resigned from the company’s board following disagreements with founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook officials,” wrote The Wall Street Journal at the time. “They differed over governance at the company and its policies around political discourse.”

Zients’ role as the incoming White House’s COVID-19 coordinator doesn’t directly affect Facebook, but with the company facing unprecedented federal scrutiny and an impending antitrust action from regulators, tech activist groups are particularly sensitive to any connections between Facebook and the Biden White House. In September, a coalition of antitrust groups called on the transition to forswear any Facebook executives or registered lobbyists tied to the company from White House appointments.

On Thursday, Accountable Tech co-founder Jesse Lehrich called Zients a “talented problem-solver” but said Facebook’s role in spreading anti-vaccine misinformation could not be ignored.

“Facebook must be held accountable for amplifying misinformation that has undermined our pandemic response and sown baseless distrust in vaccines,” Lehrich said. “In order to guard against conflicts of interest, Mr. Zients should immediately divest of the significant equity he earned in Facebook from his service on the Board and commit to hiring an online misinformation expert to handle his team’s engagement with major social media platforms.”

Zients previously served in a number of economic policy roles in the Obama administration — most notably, as director of the National Economic Council and acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.","['zients', 'accountable', 'coronavirus', 'transition', 'appointee', 'house', 'white', 'company', 'facebook', 'misinformation', 'cut', 'stock', 'board', 'team', 'ties', 'biden']"

White House c oronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said she’s frustrated that viral covid-19 “myths” like those spread by the president and other high-profile politicians continue to undermine public perception about the severity of covid-19, even now eight months into the pandemic after the virus has killed more than 281,000 people i n America.

In an interview on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Birx recounted how she’s visited communities nationwide this year to help plan how to fight the virus. Medical professionals on the frontlines told her they’re still struggling to convince people to wear masks and practice social distancing, among other basic health precautions, to curb the spread of the virus. But many government and local officials are sending mixed signals by flouting public guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal health agencies at a time when the U.S. is reporting more covid-19 cases than almost ever before.

“Right now, across the Sunbelt, we have governors and mayors who have cases equivalent to what they had in the summertime, yet aren’t putting in the same policies and mitigations that they put in the summer that they know changed the course of this pandemic,” Birx told the outlet. Though it was a virtual interview, she wore a face mask in accordance with new CDC recommendations to wear masks at all times when you’re outside your home . The agency updated its guidelines on Friday and said the pandemic had entered a phase of “high level transmission” in the U.S.

When the pandemic first peaked earlier this year, many states issued stay-at-home orders, face mask mandates, limits on gathering sizes, and other measures to keep the virus from spreading. However, that diligence has gradually worn away in some regions amid pressure from President Donald Trump and his government stooges to return to business as usual.

The effects have been obvious. The U.S. reported more than 1 million new covid-19 cases in just five days this week, and on Wednesday it set a grim new record for its single-worst daily death toll at 2,760. America leads the world in covid-19 cases with more than 14.6 million. The CDC warns that the next three months may be “the most difficult time” in the country’s public health history, and the nation’s leading infectious disease expert , Dr. Anthony Fauci, has warned people against traveling for the holidays, which could spread the virus and lead to more case spikes.

Trump’s insistence on politicizing basic scientific facts has also hampered public perception about the pandemic’s severity because the line of thinking goes, “if the president isn’t taking this whole virus thing seriously, then why should I?” Particularly in the early months of the pandemic, the president and his team repeatedly contradicted the CDC about the efficacy of face masks for slowing the virus’ spread and spouted such outrageous claims about potential coronavirus cures that people began misting themselves with bleach because, well, the president said it could work so why not?

“I hear community members parroting back those situations, parroting back that masks don’t work, parroting back that we should work toward herd immunity, parroting back that gatherings don’t result in super-spreading events,” Birx said. “And I think our job is to constantly say those are myths, they are wrong, and you can see the evidence base.”

This should all really be a no-brainer at this point, she continued:

“We know what behaviors spread the virus and we know how to change those behaviors to stop spreading the virus... We have to listen right now to what we know works, which is masks, physical distancing, and washing your hands.”

As bad as things are, they’re only likely to get worse after Christmas. According to the Associated Press, vehicle traffic on Thanksgiving Day this year was only about 5% less than in 2019, and we’re already starting to see case tallies spike after all this travel. Most Americans seem unwilling to forego their holiday get-together even if there is a pandemic raging.

“Every state across this country needs to increase their mitigation and every state needs to be critically informing their state population that the gatherings we saw in Thanksgiving will lead to a surge, it will happen this week and next week,” Birx told NBC. “We cannot go into the holiday season—Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanza—with the same kind of attitude that: ‘Those gatherings don’t apply to me.’ They apply to everyone, if you don’t want to lose your grandparents, your aunt.”

President-elect Joe Biden has promised to enforce stricter coronavirus guidelines once he takes office in January, such as issuing a face mask mandate in federal jurisdiction and asking the public to wear face masks for the first 100 days of his presidency, among others.

Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, who is part of a bipartisan group of senators hashing out a compromise on a stimulus bill, told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that they are close to an agreement and that it could come as early as Monday.

""I think we have got the top line numbers done. We are working right now on language so that we can have -- as early as tomorrow -- a piece of legislation,"" he said.

Warner said it will be a four-month emergency relief package with a $908 billion price tag. It remains uncertain whether Congress will vote on such a package as Republican and Democratic leadership negotiate how much of a stimulus plan to include in a separate, massive funding bill to keep the government open.

The Covid relief proposal, Warner said, ""will give targeted relief for the unemployed; for people in food insecurity; rental assistance; small businesses that have run out of their (Paycheck Protection Program) funds and additional funds to those minority businesses that have been extraordinarily hit hard.""

With lapsing COVID benefits expiring before the end of the year, negotiations for a new relief bill have picked up in recent days, although another round of direct $1,200 payments is looking unlikely. Here’s what you need to know.

What’s been the holdup?

Both parties agree that another relief package is necessary as COVID relief benefits from the CARES Act will expire December 31. However, negotiations remained stalled through the presidential election, as Democrats and Republicans pushed their own relief packages, the HEROES Act and HEALS Act, respectively. (The Democrat-majority H ouse actually passed the HEROES Act before it was declared “dead on arrival” by Senate Republicans). The biggest differences between these plans are:

Spending totals: Democrats originally wanted to spend $3.4 trillion (later negotiated down to $2.2 trillion), as opposed to the $1.1 trillion package offered by Republicans.

Democrats originally wanted to spend $3.4 trillion (later negotiated down to $2.2 trillion), as opposed to the $1.1 trillion package offered by Republicans. State funding: the Republicans’ plan had no direct funding relief for local governments, whereas $1 trillion of the Democrats’ plan would be spent on additional aid to state and city governments.

the Republicans’ plan had no direct funding relief for local governments, whereas $1 trillion of the Democrats’ plan would be spent on additional aid to state and city governments. Evictions and foreclosures: the Democrat’s HEROES Act broadens and extends restrictions for another year, while the Republicans would let the evictions and foreclosure restrictions lapse.

Dismal job numbers, the election of Joe Biden, and the impending expiration of the CARES Act has prompted renewed focus on passing a new bill before the end of the year. A bipartisan group has since proposed a third relief package that has gained traction, although it’s much more scaled down, totaling a proposed $908 billion. The details of the package are currently being negotiated, but will likely include:

$288 billion spent on the Paycheck Protection Program for U.S. businesses, with most of the funding directed towards small firms.



$180 billion spent on unemployment benefits to jobless Americans, who would receive $300 per week from the federal government in addition to existing state unemployment benefits.

$160 billion for states, localities, and tribal governments to help them avoid further cuts to personnel or services (much less than the $1 trillion proposed by Democrats).

$16 billion for vaccine development and distribution, as well as coronavirus testing and tracing.



A Republican liability provision for businesses that temporarily blocks pandemic-related lawsuits (a sticking point for many Democrats).

If you were expecting a second round of $1,200 in direct payments as part of the package, don’t get your hopes up—it’s not expected to be included.

So what happens now?

According to AP, lawmakers from both parties are finalizing language on the bill, which punts the matter of direct cash payments over to President-elect Joe Biden to deal with next year. The fate of direct payments is unclear, however, as that will likely depend on January’s Senate runoff race in Georgia, which will determine control of the Senate.

Last Friday, Biden expressed confidence that a bipartisan agreement would pass soon:

“I’m confident there are a sufficient number of Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate, along with significant votes coming out of the House of Representatives, to put together a serious package that will keep us from going off the edge here, provide the kind of resources that are needed immediately.”

Per CNET, on Sunday, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia and member of the bipartisan group, said “with so many of these initiatives from the first CARES package running out as soon as the day after Christmas, it would be what I call stupidity on steroids if Congress doesn’t act.”



Time is running out, however, as lawmakers will need to pass the bill before the Senate adjourns on December 18 for its holiday recess. More details around the new relief package should be released later this week, if not later today.","['direct', 'whats', 'covid', 'state', 'relief', 'latest', 'act', 'package', 'trillion', 'republicans', 'billion', 'bill', 'democrats', 'spent']"

“That’s one of the reasons why we decided that we would allocate this only through the state and only through this random allocation process,” he said, “so that no one could get a leg up by virtue of their special connections.”

And there are other complicating factors keeping many people from getting the therapies as well. The infusions must be administered in outpatient settings, but infusion centers, which also care for immune-suppressed cancer patients, are loath to treat people who have an infectious disease. And many emergency rooms are so overrun that they do not have the space.

In Utah, Dr. Fox said her hospital had shipped much of the supply of antibodies to rural hospitals, which had more room. Both she and Dr. Wynia in Colorado expressed concern that the therapies might not be distributed equitably across racial and ethnic lines, with hard-hit minority communities not getting their fair share.

The scarcity is such a problem that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine is holding a session next week to help medical professionals sort their way through rationing questions.

“We’ve been trying to get the word out so that as patients might get a positive test they could get information that they might qualify for treatment, but that only works for people with a lot of resources,” Dr. Fox said.

Politicians are not the only ones with resources getting access.

One passenger on a so-called “cruise to nowhere” in Singapore has tested positive for covid-19, just a week after Royal Caribbean cruises began operating again in the region during the coronavirus pandemic , according to the Strait Times. All 2,800 people aboard the Quantum of the Seas ship, which set sail on Dec. 3, have been forced to quarantine in their cabins.

The ship, which has 1,680 passengers and 1,148 crew members, returned to Singapore on Wednesday morning to allow the 83-year-old passenger who tested positive to be transferred to the hospital. The elderly passenger was tested for coronavirus on the ship after experiencing diarrhea.

The remaining passengers on Quantum of the Seas will have to stay on board until contact tracing has been completed, though it’s not immediately clear how long that might take. All passengers who are deemed close contacts will eventually be sent to a government quarantine facility even if they test negative for the coronavirus.

“Those close contacts have since tested negative following PCR testing and further contact tracing is ongoing. All on-board leisure activities also ceased immediately and passengers were asked to stay in their cabins,” a spokesperson for Royal Caribbean told the Strait Times.

P assengers and crew who boarded the Quantum of the Seas ship tested negative for the virus before their trip, but the incubation period for the new coronavirus can be as long as 14 days, meaning that someone can test negative for the virus during a roughly two week window, despite having been previously infected. The average incubation period is about 5-7 days. And that’s precisely why Americans were encouraged to stay home for Thanksgiving and not see family members, even if they got tested before they traveled for the holiday . A negative test doesn’t mean you can’t test positive within a relatively short period of time.

Royal Caribbean touts its adherence to social distancing guidelines and mask-wearing for all people on board the cruise, along with a contact-tracing app that’s mandatory for everyone. This particular trip was only for Singaporean nationals and Singapore has done relatively well at controlling the spread of the virus, though the country has faced criticism that so many positive cases have occurred in foreign workers living in cramped conditions.

Singapore reported just six new cases of coronavirus on Wednesday , not including the 83-year-old man who tested positive on the cruise. The elderly man is being retested on land and he will be added to the official health stats if the second test comes back positive. Singapore has recorded just over 58,000 cases of covid-19 and 29 deaths since the pandemic began earlier this year, despite having a population of roughly 5.6 million people. The state of Minnesota, by contrast, has recorded over 359,000 cases and 4,086 deaths despite having a population identical to Singapore.

The concept of so-called “cruises to the nowhere” and even “flights to nowhere” have gained traction during the covid-19 pandemic, as people long for a version of normalcy, even if it means they depart and arrive at the same destination, never leaving the ship or plane. Taking a cruise in the ocean without stopping at different destinations may seem bizarre, but there have been plenty of people willing to sign up.

An Australian “flight to nowhere” operated by Qantas sold out in just 10 minutes back in September. The seven-hour flight took off and landed in Sydney after flying by iconic landmarks like Byron Bay, Bondi Beach, and the Sydney Harbor Bridge, sometimes at a much lower altitude than normal to give passengers a better look.

The passenger who tested positive for covid-19 will receive a full refund from Royal Caribbean, according to the Strait Times, and all other passengers will receive a discount for the day they missed at sea.

Genting Cruise Lines has also begun operating “cruises to nowhere” from Singapore and that company’s World Dream ship is reportedly scheduled to depart tonight at 6:00 p.m. local time with 1,700 people on board.

Health authorities in the UK have approved a coronavirus vaccine developed by U.S.-based pharma company Pfizer and German-based biotech firm BioNTech, according to a press release from the two companies. The first doses will be given free to some of the most vulnerable Britons and health care workers early next week—welcome news to a world that’s sick and tired of this global pandemic shit.

The Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK’s equivalent to the FDA, announced the emergency use authorization of the vaccine on Wednesday, becoming the first Western nation to grant approval for a covid-19 injection that will hopefully slow the spread of the virus. Both Russia and China have developed their own vaccines which were distributed before being tested for safety and efficacy in Phase 3 clinical trials.

“It’s the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Wednesday while praising the work of regulators.

T he German government gave BioNTech $445 million to develop the vaccine , which uses a revolutionary new technique by employing messenger RNA, or mRNA. Despite attempts by the Trump regime to take credit for creating the vaccine, the U.S. government did not contribute financially to its development beyond buying millions of doses.

The UK struck a deal with BioNTech/ Pfizer back in July for 30 million doses (15 million treatments, since each person needs two doses), which was expanded in October to 40 million doses (20 million treatments). The UK has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, with at least 1.6 million infections and over 59,000 deaths in the country of 67 million people, though the U.S. is still the global epicenter of the pandemic, with more than 13.7 million confirmed cases and over 270,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

G/O Media may get a commission Sony WH-1000XM4 $218 at Backmarket Use the promo code Kinja2020

“The delivery of the 40 million doses will occur throughout 2020 and 2021, in stages, to ensure an equitable allocation of vaccines across the geographies with executed contracts,” Pfizer said in a statement about the British plan. “Now that the vaccine is authorized in the UK, the companies will take immediate action to begin the delivery of vaccine doses.”

The BioNTech/ Pfizer vaccine has a reported efficacy rate of 95%, though it must be stored at minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit, much colder than your average freezer, an obstacle that governments around the world are trying to overcome by ramping up the availability of ultra-cold storage facilities.

The UK’s nationalized health care system, the National Health Service, will distribute the vaccine for free and residents will be notified when it’s their turn to get the jab, according to UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock who spoke with the BBC this morning .

The BioNTech/ Pfizer vaccine is being produced in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and Puurs, Belgium, with flights already taking off to countries around the world in anticipation of approval by various governments and local health authorities. The first deliveries of the Pfizer vaccine to the U.S. arrived in Chicago on November 27, according to CNBC, and will likely be stored in Wisconsin before it’s distributed throughout the country.

The U.S. has an initial contract with Pfizer for 50 million doses, enough to immunize 25 million Americans, though it will be able to buy 600 million doses eventually. The U.S. has a population of over 330 million and the Trump regime has promised the vaccine will be available to all Americans for free . Japan has ordered 120 million doses from Pfizer and the EU, which has 27 member countries, has ordered 300 million doses.

A panel of experts at the CDC met on Tuesday to decide who should first get the vaccine in the U.S., and recommended prioritizing the nation’s health care workers in a vote of 13 to 1. Doctors and nurses have been devastated by the pandemic, with hundreds of thousands infected and at least 1,700 dead, to say nothing of the emotional toll this era is having on medical professionals. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield still needs to give final approval of the plan on Wednesday, something he’s widely expected to do as the FDA still needs to approval the vaccine for Americans.

Advertisement

But there’s still significant questions about who will be second in line for the vaccine after health care workers in the U.S. , according to former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb who spoke with CBS News over the long Thanksgiving weekend . The next two categories of people to be considered are likely essential workers and the elderly, which each present different challenges and benefits in a health care system with limited supply.

Prioritizing the elderly for vaccination would be smart if your goal was to immediately get the rate of deaths down. The U.S. has roughly 20 million people over the age 75 and 50 million people over the age of 65, with older people the most likely to suffer serious illness and death from covid-19. Roughly 39 percent of deaths from covid-19 in the U.S. have been in nursing homes and other facilities for the elderly, according to a recent analysis by the New York Times. But prioritizing essential workers for vaccination would be better for the U.S. economy, allowing larger portions of so-called “normal life” to resume after months of disruptions.

Here’s what you need to know:

Two vaccines might be shipped to New York soon.

The Food and Drug Administration first needs to approve the vaccines — one by Pfizer, and another by Moderna — for emergency use. It was not immediately clear when the Moderna vaccine would arrive in the state or how many people it could cover.

Both pharmaceutical companies have said trials show their vaccines are over 90 percent effective in fighting the coronavirus. Patients would need two doses.

The C.D.C. has recommended that nursing home residents and health workers get the first doses.

Mr. Cuomo said New York wanted to prioritize the vaccination of health care professionals, nursing home residents and essential workers, as well as residents of the hard-hit neighborhoods, most of whom are Black or Hispanic.

The first vaccines would likely go to the approximately 210,000 people who live or work in New York’s nursing homes. As of July, more than 6,400 nursing home residents had died from Covid-19.

The state has told the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that there are more than 800,000 critical health care workers in New York, and that they make up more than 4 percent of the population.

Getting all of those workers vaccinated could take awhile, experts said. That leaves the timeline for the average New Yorker largely unknown.

On Monday, the UK became the first country to begin mass vaccination against the novel coronavirus pandemic using a vaccine manufactured by Pifzer. That vaccine should begin being rolled out in the U.S. soon—though there might not be enough to go around for a while, thanks in part to the White House’s purchasing decisions.

The New York Times reported this week that sources say when the Trump administration negotiated a $1.95 billion deal for 100 million shots of the Pfizer vaccine under its Operation Warp Speed program—enough for around 50 million people, as it requires two doses—it ignored warnings that far more would be needed, and turned down an option to lock in rights to future purchases. Instead, the White House opted to sign a provision allowing the feds to place orders for up to 400 million more doses at some unspecified time in the future. Now, according to the Washington Post, Pfizer has told federal officials they won’t be able to buy another batch until at least late June or July, as other countries snatched up remaining capacity.

There are other vaccine candidates in the pipeline; one manufactured by Moderna, which is also a two-dose version, is expected to be cleared for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration in coming weeks. The feds have ordered 100 million doses, again enough for 50 million people. Other vaccines—such as ones developed by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson—are under development but are expected to take until February to ship.

The U.S. is one of a relative handful of wealthy nations hoarding vaccine supplies, prioritizing the welfare of their own citizens above equitable global distribution to those of other nations who might be at individually higher risk. The overall spending the federal government has allocated to vaccine development and procurement is unprecedented, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has committed to making initial taxpayer-funded doses free for recipients.

Still a study in Emerging Infectious Diseases in August 2020 estimated that 45.4 percent of the adult population of the U.S. may be at “increased risk for complications from coronavirus disease because of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease, hypertension, or cancer.”

The Trump administration is mulling an executive order to prioritize vaccine distribution to Americans, but it hasn’t explained how the order will actually secure more doses. Moncef Slaoui, the pharmaceutical executive appointed by Trump to head Warp Speed, appeared baffled and out of the loop when questioned about the order on ABC News’ Good Morning America on Tuesday.

“Frankly, I don’t know, and frankly, I’m staying out of this,” Slaoui told ABC. “I can’t comment. I literally don’t know.”

A senior administration official—albeit speaking anonymously—told the Post that they’re not miserly cheapskates, of course, but that the U.S. government had not hedged its bets on any one particular vaccine.

“Anyone who wanted to sell us … without an [FDA] approval, hundreds of millions of doses back in July and August, was just not going to get the government’s money,” the official told the paper.

Another anonymous administration official told CNN, “they shouldn’t have closed the door [to more doses]... they could have left the door open.” The official added that “it’s going to look bad” if the competing vaccines aren’t as effective.

The Post wrote that Pfizer might be able to provide 50 million more doses by the end of Q2 and an additional 50 million by the end of Q3 (the end of September):

It was only last weekend, with a Food and Drug Administration clearance expected any day, that federal officials reached back out to the company asking to buy another 100 million doses. By then, Pfizer said it had committed the supply elsewhere and suggested elevating the conversation to “a high level discussion,” said a person familiar with the talks. Pfizer said the company might be able to provide 50 million doses at the end of the second quarter, and another 50 million doses in the third quarter, the individuals said.

The White House has splurged on other pet projects, such as unproven treatments for the coronavirus touted by Trump as potential miracle cures.

As of July, the federal government (along with some state governments) spent at least $86.5 million and likely far more researching and procuring hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug with unproven efficacy in treating the novel coronavirus. Flimsy initial research was spun by right wing media reports—later echoed by the president himself—asserting that Democrats and federal scientists were holding up the drug’s distribution for political reasons. Later research indicated hydroxychloroquine is useless in the fight against the coronavirus.

The entire cost of the 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine the U.S. has purchased so far comes to just shy of between 14 and 18 F-35 fighter jets, based on figures by POGO.

Slaoui told ABC on Tuesday that the summer was the wrong time to purchase additional vaccines, according to CNN.

“Let me remind everybody what our strategy is and has always been,” Slaoui told ABC. “We selected six different vaccines to build the portfolio, to manage the risk that some may work and some may not work, but also to ensure that as more than one would work that we would accumulate vaccine doses from this portfolio of vaccines.”

“...If somebody came to us and said, ‘Let’s buy more of this vaccine or that vaccine,’ no one reasonably would buy more from any one of those vaccines because we didn’t know which one would work and which one may be better than the other,” Slaoui added.

Update: 4:15 p.m. ET: Former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb—who, it must be pointed out, is on Pfizer’s board —claimed that the White House knew that interim data from manufacturers showed Pfizer’s vaccine was likely going to be effective when it turned down an expanded allotment .","['million', 'covid19', 'buy', 'white', 'doses', 'trump', 'administration', '50', 'report', 'work', 'pfizers', 'federal', 'vaccine', 'chance', 'told', 'turned', 'pfizer']"
